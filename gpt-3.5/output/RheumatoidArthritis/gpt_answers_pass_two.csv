In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, anterior uveitis can be a manifestation of the systemic autoimmune process. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis presents with anterior uveitis, it is highly likely that the uveitis is specific to the Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deformity of hand,4182643,True,"Yes, deformity of the hand can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction can lead to deformities in the hands, such as swan-neck deformity, boutonniere deformity, and ulnar drift. These deformities are characteristic of RA and can be a key clinical feature in diagnosing the disease. Therefore, if a patient presents with deformity of the hand, it may strongly suggest the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hip pain,4170554,False,"No

Rationale: Hip pain is a symptom that can be associated with various conditions, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis. While hip pain can be a symptom of RA, it is not specific to RA as it can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, bursitis, tendonitis, or even a hip fracture. Therefore, having hip pain does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rheumatic heart disease,319825,False,"No

Rheumatic heart disease is a condition that results from rheumatic fever, which is caused by an untreated streptococcal infection. It primarily affects the heart valves, leading to damage and dysfunction. While both rheumatic heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis are autoimmune conditions, they affect different parts of the body and have distinct pathophysiologies. Therefore, having rheumatic heart disease does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis, and vice versa."
Acquired deformity of finger,78524,True,"Yes, an acquired deformity of the finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction and deformities are common due to chronic inflammation and damage to the synovial joints. Deformities such as swan neck deformity, boutonniere deformity, and ulnar deviation of the fingers are characteristic of RA. Therefore, if a person has an acquired deformity of the finger, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause."
Autoimmune endocrine disease,4028942,False,"No, the condition of autoimmune endocrine disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While autoimmune diseases can coexist and patients with RA may have other autoimmune conditions, having an autoimmune endocrine disease does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Autoimmune endocrine diseases involve the immune system attacking the endocrine glands, leading to hormonal imbalances, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the joints. Therefore, the presence of an autoimmune endocrine disease does not necessarily indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Myasthenia gravis,76685,False,"No, myasthenia gravis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly in the muscles that control eye movements, facial expressions, chewing, swallowing, and speaking. It is caused by antibodies attacking acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. While both rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis are autoimmune disorders, they affect different systems in the body (joints vs. neuromuscular junction) and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having myasthenia gravis does not necessarily mean that a person also has rheumatoid arthritis."
Sequelae of disorders classified by disorder-system,4181217,False,"No, the condition ""Sequelae of disorders classified by disorder-system"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition refers to the long-term effects or complications that result from a previous disorder, which can be related to various different diseases or conditions. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can lead to sequelae such as joint deformities and functional impairment, these sequelae can also be seen in other conditions. Therefore, having sequelae of disorders classified by disorder-system does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic arthritis,4262443,True,"Yes, chronic arthritis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chronic arthritis is a general term that refers to long-lasting inflammation in the joints, which is a key feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, it is important to note that chronic arthritis can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis or psoriatic arthritis, so further evaluation and diagnostic criteria are needed to confirm Rheumatoid Arthritis as the specific malady in this case."
"Localized, primary osteoarthritis of the shoulder region",73840,False,"No

Rationale: Localized, primary osteoarthritis of the shoulder region is a specific condition that refers to degenerative joint disease affecting the shoulder joint. While osteoarthritis can present with joint pain and stiffness similar to RA, it is a distinct condition characterized by wear and tear of the joint cartilage rather than an autoimmune inflammatory process affecting multiple joints like RA. Therefore, having localized, primary osteoarthritis of the shoulder region does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Degenerative joint disease of ankle AND/OR foot,4219481,False,"No, degenerative joint disease of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Degenerative joint disease, also known as osteoarthritis, is a separate condition characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune disorder, osteoarthritis is typically due to wear and tear on the joints over time. Although both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and treatment approaches. Therefore, having degenerative joint disease of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Full thickness rotator cuff tear,73564,False,"No

Rationale: A full thickness rotator cuff tear is a specific injury to the tendons of the shoulder joint, typically caused by trauma or overuse. While it can cause pain and limited range of motion in the shoulder, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, not isolated tendon tears in the shoulder."
Splenomegaly,200527,False,"No, splenomegaly is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While splenomegaly can be seen in some cases of RA due to systemic inflammation, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Splenomegaly can be caused by a variety of other conditions such as infections, liver disease, or blood disorders. Therefore, the presence of splenomegaly does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of sacrum,138841,False,"No, a disorder of the sacrum is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not specifically target the sacrum. A disorder of the sacrum could be related to various other conditions such as sacroiliitis, sacral fractures, or sacral tumors, which are not exclusive to RA."

Rationale: Localized osteoarthrosis is a condition that primarily affects the joints due to wear and tear, leading to degeneration of the cartilage and bone. While osteoarthritis can present with similar symptoms to rheumatoid arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the synovial joints, whereas osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease. Therefore, having localized osteoarthrosis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Elbow joint inflamed,4184090,True,"Yes, the condition ""Elbow joint inflamed"" could be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint inflammation is a key feature, and it commonly affects multiple joints, including the elbows. The presence of joint inflammation in the elbow could be indicative of RA, especially if it is accompanied by other symptoms such as morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling in other joints. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of elbow joint inflammation, such as trauma or other forms of arthritis, before definitively linking it to RA."
Lateral epicondylitis,81379,False,"No, lateral epicondylitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, is a condition characterized by pain and inflammation on the outer part of the elbow. It is typically caused by overuse of the forearm muscles and tendons. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop lateral epicondylitis as a secondary condition due to joint inflammation and stress on the tendons, having lateral epicondylitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of hip,4079749,False,"No.

Rationale: Osteoarthritis of the hip is a degenerative joint disease primarily affecting the hip joint due to wear and tear over time. While both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis can cause joint pain and stiffness, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting multiple joints symmetrically, while osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease affecting specific joints like the hip. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the hip does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Degeneration of lumbar intervertebral disc,443769,False,"No.

Rationale:
Degeneration of lumbar intervertebral disc is a condition that primarily affects the spine, specifically the intervertebral discs in the lumbar region. While this condition can cause symptoms such as back pain and stiffness, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having degeneration of lumbar intervertebral disc does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune connective tissue disorder,4179877,True,"Yes, the condition ""Autoimmune connective tissue disorder"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints, which are part of the connective tissue. Therefore, if someone has an autoimmune connective tissue disorder, it is likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finding of finger joint,4184709,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Finding of finger joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is a key feature, and the small joints of the hands are commonly affected, leading to symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and deformities. Therefore, if a person has the condition of ""Finding of finger joint,"" it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Lumbar spondylosis,4346975,False,"No, lumbar spondylosis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Lumbar spondylosis is a degenerative condition affecting the spine, specifically the lumbar region. It is characterized by degeneration of the intervertebral discs and the formation of bone spurs in the spine. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, lumbar spondylosis primarily affects the spine, while Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints. Therefore, having lumbar spondylosis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of subcutaneous tissue,4132999,False,"No, a disorder of subcutaneous tissue is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not specifically target the subcutaneous tissue. A disorder of subcutaneous tissue could be indicative of other conditions such as lipomas, cellulitis, or panniculitis, but it is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Nontraumatic rotator cuff tear,4172970,False,"No

Rationale: A nontraumatic rotator cuff tear is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may be at an increased risk for developing rotator cuff tears due to chronic inflammation and joint damage, a rotator cuff tear can occur in individuals without RA as well. Therefore, having a nontraumatic rotator cuff tear does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of pelvis,44783158,False,"No

Rationale:
Arthritis of the pelvis is a general term referring to inflammation of the joints in the pelvis area. While rheumatoid arthritis can affect various joints in the body, including those in the pelvis, the presence of arthritis in the pelvis alone does not definitively indicate rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings as mentioned in the description. Therefore, having arthritis of the pelvis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Sacroiliac disorder,4001453,False,"No

Rationale:
Sacroiliac disorder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While sacroiliac joint involvement can occur in some cases of RA, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Sacroiliac disorder can be caused by various other conditions such as trauma, infection, or inflammatory conditions like ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, having a sacroiliac disorder does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cardiomyopathy associated with another disorder,320746,False,"No, cardiomyopathy associated with another disorder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is primarily a joint disorder, it can also have systemic effects, including cardiovascular involvement such as pericarditis or vasculitis. However, cardiomyopathy associated with another disorder is a broad term that can be caused by various conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or genetic disorders, not just RA. Therefore, having cardiomyopathy associated with another disorder does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Alveolar pneumopathy,4252581,False,"No. Alveolar pneumopathy is a condition affecting the alveoli in the lungs, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the joints, it can also have systemic effects on other organs, including the lungs. However, alveolar pneumopathy is not a defining characteristic of RA and can be caused by various other conditions such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or environmental factors. Therefore, having alveolar pneumopathy does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Dilated cardiomyopathy,4163710,False,"No

Rationale: Dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition that affects the heart muscle, leading to enlargement and weakening of the heart chambers. While there have been some reported cases of rheumatoid arthritis patients developing dilated cardiomyopathy, the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, dilated cardiomyopathy is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
SjÃ¶gren's syndrome,254443,True,"Yes, Sjögren's syndrome can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the exocrine glands, leading to symptoms such as dry eyes and dry mouth. It is commonly associated with other autoimmune diseases, including Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has Sjögren's syndrome, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, not all patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis will have Sjögren's syndrome."
Pericarditis,4138837,False,"No, pericarditis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While pericarditis can be a complication of RA due to systemic inflammation, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, and can be caused by various factors such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or heart attacks. Therefore, having pericarditis does not definitively mean a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of left lower extremity,764156,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of left lower extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple joints throughout the body, not just the left lower extremity. The condition described is too general and could be indicative of a wide range of musculoskeletal or neurological issues, not necessarily RA. Additional information such as joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to definitively link this condition to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of right lower extremity,764155,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of right lower extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple joints throughout the body, not just the right lower extremity. The condition described is too general and could be indicative of a wide range of musculoskeletal or neurological issues, not necessarily RA. Additional information such as joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to definitively link this condition to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Small vessel vasculitis,37110370,True,"Yes, small vessel vasculitis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Small vessel vasculitis is a known extra-articular manifestation of RA, where inflammation affects the small blood vessels in various organs, leading to symptoms such as skin rash, nerve damage, and kidney problems. Therefore, if a patient with RA presents with small vessel vasculitis, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cellulitis of finger,4100662,False,"No

Rationale:
Cellulitis of the finger is a bacterial skin infection that can occur in anyone, regardless of whether they have rheumatoid arthritis. While individuals with rheumatoid arthritis may be at a higher risk of developing infections due to their compromised immune system, the presence of cellulitis of the finger does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, cellulitis of the finger is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Joint effusion of ankle AND/OR foot,77072,True,"Yes, joint effusion of the ankle and/or foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Joint effusion, or swelling within the joint, is a common symptom of RA due to the inflammation and synovitis that characterizes the disease. In RA, joint effusion is often accompanied by other symptoms such as morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, if a patient presents with joint effusion of the ankle and/or foot, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune liver disease,4340391,False,"No, autoimmune liver disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions are autoimmune in nature, they affect different organ systems. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the joints, while autoimmune liver disease affects the liver. It is possible for a person to have both conditions, but having autoimmune liver disease does not definitively mean that the person also has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Abscess of finger,4052222,False,"No, an abscess of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. An abscess is a localized collection of pus within tissues that can occur due to a bacterial infection. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may be at a higher risk for infections due to their compromised immune system, an abscess of the finger is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to address and treat the abscess separately from managing the Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Thoracic arthritis,4304035,False,"No, thoracic arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Thoracic arthritis refers to inflammation in the joints of the thoracic spine, which can be caused by various conditions such as osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or other inflammatory disorders. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints in the hands and feet, it can also involve the spine in some cases. Therefore, having thoracic arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis, as there are other potential causes for thoracic joint inflammation."
Knee joint inflamed,4184091,True,"Yes, the condition ""Knee joint inflamed"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint inflammation is a hallmark feature, and knee joint involvement is common in this condition. The presence of knee joint inflammation in a patient would strongly suggest the possibility of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a characteristic symptom of the disease. Additionally, the description of RA mentions that joint swelling and tenderness are key clinical features, which align with the condition of knee joint inflammation. Therefore, if a patient has knee joint inflammation, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acute arthritis,4000634,False,"No, acute arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute arthritis refers to sudden onset joint inflammation, which can be caused by various conditions such as infection, crystal deposition diseases (e.g., gout), trauma, or reactive arthritis. While acute arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not exclusive to this specific malady and can be seen in other conditions as well. Additional diagnostic criteria such as serological markers and imaging findings are needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of wrist,4035441,False,"No, osteoarthritis of the wrist is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While both osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Osteoarthritis is primarily due to wear and tear on the joints over time, while Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the wrist does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Spondyloarthritis,37205058,False,"No, spondyloarthritis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Spondyloarthritis is a group of inflammatory diseases that primarily affect the spine and sacroiliac joints, including conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and enteropathic arthritis. While some symptoms of spondyloarthritis may overlap with rheumatoid arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having spondyloarthritis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Infection of finger,4100908,False,"No, an infection of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may be at a higher risk for infections due to their compromised immune system from the disease and immunosuppressive medications used to treat it, an infection of the finger can occur in individuals without RA as well. Infection of the finger is a separate condition that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, and is typically treated with antibiotics or antifungal medications, depending on the cause of the infection."
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia,441269,True,"Yes, autoimmune hemolytic anemia can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys red blood cells, leading to anemia. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, autoimmune processes are already at play, as it is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Therefore, it is possible for someone with Rheumatoid Arthritis to also develop autoimmune hemolytic anemia as a result of the immune system dysfunction seen in both conditions."
Autoimmune bullous dermatosis,36716818,False,"No

Rationale:
Autoimmune bullous dermatosis is a group of rare autoimmune skin disorders characterized by the presence of blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. While autoimmune conditions can coexist with rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of autoimmune bullous dermatosis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having autoimmune bullous dermatosis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Synovial cyst of knee,4347174,False,"No

Rationale: A synovial cyst of the knee is a fluid-filled sac that forms in the knee joint due to excess synovial fluid. While it may cause symptoms such as swelling and pain in the knee joint, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial cysts can occur in various conditions affecting the knee joint, including osteoarthritis, meniscal tears, and ligament injuries. Therefore, having a synovial cyst of the knee does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Disorder of left upper extremity,764154,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of left upper extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the upper extremities, a disorder of the left upper extremity could be caused by a variety of other conditions such as trauma, nerve compression, tendonitis, or other forms of arthritis. Therefore, having a disorder of the left upper extremity does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of right upper extremity,764153,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of right upper extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple joints throughout the body, not just the right upper extremity. Additionally, the description of RA does not mention a specific focus on the right upper extremity as a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having a disorder of the right upper extremity does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosing spondylitis,437082,False,"No, ankylosing spondylitis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to stiffness, pain, and eventually fusion of the spine. While both ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis are autoimmune inflammatory disorders, they affect different joints and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Ankylosing spondylitis is associated with the HLA-B27 genetic marker and typically presents with back pain and stiffness that improves with exercise, whereas rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, having ankylosing spondylitis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis, and vice versa."
Patellar tendonitis,433000,False,"No, patellar tendonitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Patellar tendonitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the patellar tendon, which connects the kneecap to the shinbone. It is typically caused by overuse or repetitive stress on the tendon, such as from activities like running or jumping. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop patellar tendonitis as a secondary issue due to joint inflammation and altered biomechanics, having patellar tendonitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Shoulder joint inflamed,4184089,False,"No

Rationale: While shoulder joint inflammation can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to this malady. Shoulder joint inflammation can be caused by a variety of conditions such as rotator cuff injuries, bursitis, or osteoarthritis. Therefore, having a shoulder joint inflamed does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Subcutaneous nodule,4316084,True,"Yes, a subcutaneous nodule is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Subcutaneous nodules are a classic extra-articular manifestation of RA, typically found over extensor surfaces such as the elbows. These nodules are firm, non-tender, and can vary in size. While not all patients with RA will develop subcutaneous nodules, the presence of these nodules is highly suggestive of RA and can aid in the diagnosis of the disease."
Arthropathy of left hip joint,761507,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the left hip joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the hips. The presence of arthropathy in the left hip joint could be indicative of RA, especially if other joints are also affected. Additionally, RA is known to cause joint destruction and deformities, which can manifest as arthropathy in the hip joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy of the left hip joint, it is possible that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of bilateral hip joints,36687058,True,"Yes, arthropathy of bilateral hip joints can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric, and the hip joints can be affected. The presence of arthropathy in both hip joints can be a sign of RA, especially when combined with other clinical criteria such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. Additionally, imaging findings such as joint erosions on X-ray can support the diagnosis of RA in this case. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy of bilateral hip joints, they may definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rheumatic fever,442313,False,"No, rheumatic fever is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can develop as a complication of untreated strep throat caused by group A Streptococcus bacteria. It primarily affects the heart, joints, skin, and brain. While both conditions involve inflammation and can affect joints, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria."
Juvenile chronic arthritis,4079731,True,"Yes, juvenile chronic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile chronic arthritis is a term used to describe a group of chronic inflammatory joint diseases that begin before the age of 16 and persist for at least 6 weeks. Rheumatoid Arthritis is one of the subtypes of juvenile chronic arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has juvenile chronic arthritis, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, not all patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis will have juvenile chronic arthritis, as RA can also occur in adults."
Antiphospholipid syndrome,4098292,False,"No, Antiphospholipid syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which can lead to blood clots, pregnancy complications, and other symptoms. While autoimmune disorders like Rheumatoid Arthritis and Antiphospholipid syndrome can coexist in some patients, having Antiphospholipid syndrome does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Each condition has its own distinct set of symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and treatment options."
Secondary nonischemic congestive cardiomyopathy,44783568,True,"Yes, secondary nonischemic congestive cardiomyopathy is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Secondary nonischemic congestive cardiomyopathy can be a complication of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, chronic inflammation can lead to systemic effects, including cardiovascular complications such as cardiomyopathy. Therefore, if a patient has secondary nonischemic congestive cardiomyopathy, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune vasculitis,4146124,False,"No, autoimmune vasculitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions are autoimmune disorders, they affect different parts of the body. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, while autoimmune vasculitis involves inflammation of blood vessels. Therefore, having autoimmune vasculitis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis, and vice versa."
Congenital anomaly of finger,4051577,False,"No, a congenital anomaly of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Congenital anomalies of the finger refer to structural abnormalities present at birth, which are not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that characterizes Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop joint deformities in the fingers over time, the presence of a congenital anomaly of the finger does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune skin disease,4319304,False,"No, the condition ""Autoimmune skin disease"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is an autoimmune disease, it primarily affects the joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Autoimmune skin diseases, on the other hand, primarily affect the skin and may present with symptoms such as rashes, blisters, and itching. While some autoimmune diseases may coexist with RA, the presence of an autoimmune skin disease alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of RA in a patient with an autoimmune skin disease."
Disorder of vertebra,4330086,False,"No, a disorder of vertebra is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is not typically associated with disorders of the vertebrae. Disorders of the vertebrae may be more commonly seen in conditions such as degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, or ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, having a disorder of the vertebra does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Adhesive capsulitis of left shoulder,762207,False,"No, adhesive capsulitis of the left shoulder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint, limiting range of motion. It is caused by inflammation and tightening of the capsule surrounding the shoulder joint. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect multiple joints, including the shoulder, adhesive capsulitis is not unique to RA and can be caused by other factors such as injury, overuse, or other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, having adhesive capsulitis of the left shoulder does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Sequelae of inflammatory diseases,4178949,False,"No, the condition ""Sequelae of inflammatory diseases"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. The term ""sequelae"" refers to the aftereffects or consequences of a disease, which can occur in various inflammatory conditions, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having sequelae of inflammatory diseases does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis specifically."
Secondary inflammatory arthritis,4035744,True,"Yes, secondary inflammatory arthritis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Secondary inflammatory arthritis refers to arthritis that develops as a result of another condition, such as an autoimmune disease like RA. Since RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, if a patient has secondary inflammatory arthritis due to an autoimmune condition, it is likely that the underlying cause is Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has secondary inflammatory arthritis, they may definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of elbow,4083695,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis of the elbow is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the elbow joint, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. While both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are types of arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and characteristics. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease primarily affecting the cartilage. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the elbow does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Adhesive capsulitis of right shoulder,762206,False,"No

Rationale: Adhesive capsulitis of the right shoulder, also known as frozen shoulder, is a condition characterized by pain and stiffness in the shoulder joint. While it can cause joint swelling and limited range of motion, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Adhesive capsulitis can be caused by various factors such as injury, surgery, or underlying medical conditions like diabetes. Therefore, having adhesive capsulitis of the right shoulder does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Rheumatoid factor negative,4014120,True,"Yes, the condition ""Rheumatoid factor negative"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid factor (RF) is an autoantibody that is commonly found in the blood of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, approximately 20-30% of patients with RA are negative for RF. Therefore, if a patient is Rheumatoid factor negative, it does not rule out the possibility of having Rheumatoid Arthritis. In contrast, if a patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis, they may or may not have a positive Rheumatoid factor. So, the presence of being Rheumatoid factor negative is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Seronegative arthritis,4163270,False,"No, seronegative arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Seronegative arthritis refers to a group of inflammatory joint disorders that do not test positive for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, which are commonly associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. While some patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may have seronegative arthritis, not all cases of seronegative arthritis are indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having seronegative arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Erythema multiforme,132702,False,"No, erythema multiforme is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Erythema multiforme is a skin condition characterized by target-like lesions on the skin, often triggered by infections or medications. It is not a symptom or sign typically associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can coexist in the same individual, the presence of erythema multiforme does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acute polyarthritis,4179092,True,"Yes, acute polyarthritis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute polyarthritis is a condition characterized by inflammation in multiple joints, which is a common presentation in Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, acute polyarthritis typically involves symmetric joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness in multiple joints, particularly in the hands and feet. Therefore, if a patient presents with acute polyarthritis, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as a potential underlying cause."
Autoimmune cholangitis,37017388,False,"No, autoimmune cholangitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Autoimmune cholangitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the bile ducts in the liver, leading to bile flow obstruction and liver damage. While autoimmune diseases like RA can coexist with other autoimmune conditions, the presence of autoimmune cholangitis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of RA in a patient with autoimmune cholangitis."
Extension deformity of finger,4069538,True,"Yes, an extension deformity of the finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction and deformities are common, and extension deformities of the fingers can occur due to chronic inflammation and damage to the joints. This deformity is often seen in advanced stages of RA and can significantly impact hand function. Therefore, if a patient presents with an extension deformity of the finger, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Subluxation of finger,4138155,False,"No

Rationale: Subluxation of a finger refers to a partial dislocation of the joint in the finger. While subluxation of a finger can occur in various conditions, including trauma or repetitive stress injuries, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Subluxation of a finger can be seen in a variety of musculoskeletal conditions and is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Pneumoconiosis,259044,False,"No.

Rationale:
Pneumoconiosis is a group of lung diseases caused by the inhalation of dust particles, typically in an occupational setting. It is not directly related to Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the joints. While some autoimmune diseases may have lung involvement, pneumoconiosis is not a specific condition associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Knee pyogenic arthritis,4346970,True,"Yes, knee pyogenic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic arthritis is a type of joint infection that can occur in any joint, including the knee. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints can increase the risk of developing secondary infections, such as pyogenic arthritis. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops knee pyogenic arthritis, it is highly likely that the two conditions are related."
Autoimmune thrombocytopenia,4028065,True,"Yes, autoimmune thrombocytopenia can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Autoimmune thrombocytopenia is a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets, leading to a low platelet count. This condition can be associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis as both are autoimmune disorders. In some cases, autoimmune thrombocytopenia can be a manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, where the immune system not only attacks the joints but also targets platelets. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis also has autoimmune thrombocytopenia, it is highly likely that the two conditions are related."
Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome,4164770,False,"No, Guillain-Barré syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. It is not directly related to the joint inflammation and destruction seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions involve autoimmune processes, they affect different systems in the body and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria."
"Localized, primary osteoarthritis of elbow",4197477,False,"No

Rationale: Localized, primary osteoarthritis of the elbow is a specific condition that affects the elbow joint due to wear and tear over time, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. While osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having localized, primary osteoarthritis of the elbow does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Foreign body - finger,4170462,False,"No, the condition ""Foreign body - finger"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body in the finger refers to an object that has become lodged in the finger tissue, which can cause pain, swelling, and inflammation. This is a physical issue rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a foreign body in the finger can cause symptoms similar to RA, the presence of a foreign body does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Monoarthritis,44783376,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis typically presents as symmetric polyarthritis, affecting multiple joints, rather than just one joint (monoarthritis). While monoarthritis can be a symptom of various conditions, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having monoarthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hand joint inflamed,4182008,True,"Yes, the condition ""Hand joint inflamed"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint inflammation, particularly in the small joints of the hands, is a hallmark feature. Patients with RA often present with joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness in the hands and feet. Therefore, if someone has inflamed hand joints, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile seronegative polyarthritis,4132810,True,"Yes, juvenile seronegative polyarthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Juvenile seronegative polyarthritis refers to a type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) characterized by inflammation in five or more joints, with a negative rheumatoid factor. This condition is considered a subtype of JIA and shares similarities with adult-onset Rheumatoid Arthritis, including joint involvement, symmetrical polyarthritis, and joint destruction. Therefore, if a patient has juvenile seronegative polyarthritis, they definitely have a form of arthritis that is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Skin necrosis,4317266,False,"No

Rationale: Skin necrosis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Skin necrosis can occur in various conditions such as vasculitis, thrombotic disorders, and infections. While skin necrosis can be a rare complication of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having skin necrosis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Injury of nail,4167909,False,"No, injury of nail is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience changes in their nails due to inflammation in the joints, injury of the nail can occur for various reasons unrelated to RA, such as trauma or fungal infections. Therefore, having an injury of the nail does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Still's disease with juvenile onset and/or adult onset,4261026,True,"Yes, Still's disease with juvenile onset and/or adult onset is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Still's disease is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder that can present with symptoms similar to those of Rheumatoid Arthritis, such as joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness. In some cases, Still's disease can progress to a form of chronic arthritis that resembles Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has Still's disease with juvenile or adult onset, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Localized, secondary osteoarthritis of the ankle and/or foot",80183,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Localized, secondary osteoarthritis of the ankle and/or foot is a specific condition that is not synonymous with the systemic autoimmune disease of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions involve joint pain and swelling, the specific characteristics and underlying mechanisms differ. Therefore, having localized, secondary osteoarthritis of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that an individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acute rheumatic endocarditis,437897,False,"No, acute rheumatic endocarditis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute rheumatic endocarditis refers to inflammation of the endocardium (inner lining of the heart) due to rheumatic fever, which is a complication of untreated streptococcal infections. While both conditions involve inflammation and are autoimmune in nature, they affect different parts of the body and have different underlying causes. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the joints, while acute rheumatic endocarditis affects the heart. Therefore, having acute rheumatic endocarditis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Post traumatic osteoarthritis,44783205,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a distinct autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while post-traumatic osteoarthritis is a form of osteoarthritis that develops after a joint injury. While both conditions can affect the joints and cause pain and swelling, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having post-traumatic osteoarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Episcleritis,4218083,False,"No

Rationale:
Episcleritis is a localized inflammation of the episclera, which is the thin, transparent layer covering the white part of the eye. While episcleritis can be associated with autoimmune conditions like RA, it is not specific to RA. Episcleritis can also occur in other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or be idiopathic. Therefore, having episcleritis does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Infective arthritis of shoulder region,4180873,False,"No, infective arthritis of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is a bacterial infection of a joint that can affect any joint in the body, including the shoulder. It is characterized by joint pain, swelling, redness, and limited range of motion. The presence of infective arthritis of the shoulder region does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a separate condition caused by a bacterial infection rather than an autoimmune disorder like RA. Additional diagnostic tests and evaluation would be needed to determine if a patient with infective arthritis of the shoulder region also has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease,4108968,False,"No, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the eyes, skin, and nervous system. It is characterized by inflammation of the uvea (middle layer of the eye), leading to symptoms such as vision changes, eye pain, and sensitivity to light. While both conditions are autoimmune disorders, they affect different parts of the body and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria."
Infective arthritis of ankle and/or foot,40481620,False,"No, infective arthritis of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis is caused by an infection in the joint, leading to inflammation and symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. While some symptoms may overlap with RA, the underlying cause is different. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease, whereas infective arthritis is caused by an infection. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Flexion deformity of finger,4068232,True,"Yes, a flexion deformity of the finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction can lead to deformities and functional impairment, including flexion deformities of the fingers. This condition is commonly seen in patients with RA due to the chronic inflammation and joint damage characteristic of the disease. Therefore, if a patient presents with a flexion deformity of the finger, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Polyneuropathy in collagen vascular disease,375260,True,"Yes, polyneuropathy in collagen vascular disease can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Polyneuropathy is a common extra-articular manifestation of RA, affecting up to 60% of patients with the disease. It is believed to be caused by immune-mediated inflammation affecting peripheral nerves. Therefore, if a patient with RA presents with polyneuropathy, it is highly likely that the polyneuropathy is specific to their Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Wrist joint inflamed,4185031,True,"Yes, the condition ""Wrist joint inflamed"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint inflammation is a hallmark feature, and the wrist joint is commonly affected in this condition. The presence of wrist joint inflammation is a key clinical sign that aligns with the diagnostic criteria for RA, making it a specific indicator of this particular malady."
Monoarthritis of knee,44782455,False,"No, monoarthritis of the knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Monoarthritis refers to inflammation in a single joint, in this case, the knee. While RA can affect multiple joints, including the knee, monoarthritis of the knee can be caused by various other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, septic arthritis, or injury. Therefore, having monoarthritis of the knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to determine the underlying cause of the knee inflammation."
Hip joint inflamed,4185034,True,"Yes, the condition ""Hip joint inflamed"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint inflammation is a hallmark feature, and it commonly affects the synovial joints, including the hip joint. The presence of hip joint inflammation in a patient would strongly suggest the possibility of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a common site of involvement in this condition. Additionally, the symmetric polyarthritis seen in RA can affect multiple joints, including the hip joint. Therefore, if a patient has hip joint inflammation, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tuberculosis of vertebral column,81496,False,"No

Rationale: Tuberculosis of the vertebral column, also known as Pott's disease, is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can present with joint pain and inflammation, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Tuberculosis of the vertebral column is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the spine, leading to destruction of the vertebral bodies and surrounding structures. In contrast, Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having tuberculosis of the vertebral column does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Periostitis,440822,False,"No, periostitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Periostitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the periosteum, which is the connective tissue that covers the outer surface of bones. It can be caused by various factors such as trauma, infection, or repetitive stress. While periostitis can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to chronic inflammation affecting the joints, it is not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having periostitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Occupational lung disease,4312754,False,"No

Rationale: Occupational lung disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the joints, it does not specifically involve the lungs. Occupational lung disease refers to a group of lung conditions caused by exposure to harmful substances in the workplace, such as asbestos, silica, or coal dust. These conditions can lead to symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, and chest pain, but they are not directly related to RA."
Monoarticular joint involvement,4097458,True,"Yes, monoarticular joint involvement can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis, it is possible for RA to initially present with monoarticular joint involvement in some cases. This can be seen early in the disease course before it progresses to involve multiple joints. Therefore, if a patient has monoarticular joint involvement, they may have Rheumatoid Arthritis, but not all patients with RA will present with monoarticular joint involvement."
Discitis,4046205,False,"No, discitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Discitis is an infection or inflammation of the intervertebral disc space, typically caused by bacteria. It is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints. While discitis can cause back pain and stiffness, it is not a defining symptom of RA. Therefore, having discitis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finger clubbing,134746,False,"No

Rationale:
Finger clubbing is a physical sign characterized by enlargement of the fingertips and nails, resulting in a bulbous appearance. While finger clubbing can be associated with various conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and gastrointestinal disorders, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the presence of finger clubbing does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Autoimmune encephalitis,4318558,False,"No, autoimmune encephalitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Autoimmune encephalitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the brain due to an autoimmune response, leading to symptoms such as confusion, memory problems, seizures, and psychiatric symptoms. While autoimmune diseases like RA can coexist with autoimmune encephalitis, having autoimmune encephalitis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. The two conditions involve different organs and systems in the body, with RA primarily affecting the joints and autoimmune encephalitis affecting the brain."
Arthropathy of the ankle AND/OR foot associated with a neurological disorder,4326356,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot associated with a neurological disorder can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is a key feature, and it can affect the ankles and feet. Additionally, neurological disorders can sometimes be associated with RA due to inflammation affecting nerves. Therefore, if a patient presents with arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot associated with a neurological disorder, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune leukopenia,4051056,False,"No, autoimmune leukopenia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Autoimmune leukopenia refers to a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys white blood cells, leading to a decrease in the number of these cells in the blood. While autoimmune conditions like RA can be associated with leukopenia as a result of the immune system dysfunction, leukopenia can also occur in other conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), aplastic anemia, and certain infections. Therefore, having autoimmune leukopenia does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Shoulder synovitis,4035431,True,"Yes, shoulder synovitis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, synovitis is a key feature of the disease, characterized by inflammation of the synovial lining of the joints. Since RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including the shoulder joints, the presence of shoulder synovitis can be a strong indicator of RA. Additionally, shoulder synovitis can be one of the clinical criteria used for diagnosing RA. Therefore, if a patient has shoulder synovitis, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease,37312293,False,"No, the condition of Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is a rare autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the kidneys and lungs, characterized by the presence of antibodies targeting the glomerular basement membrane. While both conditions are autoimmune in nature, they affect different organs and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease does not necessarily mean that a person also has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Eaton-Lambert syndrome,4237155,False,"No, Eaton-Lambert syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Eaton-Lambert syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness, particularly in the proximal muscles, and is caused by antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels at the neuromuscular junction. While both conditions are autoimmune disorders, they affect different systems in the body (muscles vs. joints) and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having Eaton-Lambert syndrome does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of elbow,40483813,False,"No, infective arthritis of the elbow is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis is caused by an infection in the joint, leading to inflammation and symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can present with joint symptoms, they have different underlying causes and treatment approaches. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the elbow does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Heberden node,4155797,True,"Yes, a Heberden node is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

A Heberden node is a bony enlargement of the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) that is commonly associated with osteoarthritis. However, in the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, Heberden nodes can also be present. In RA, joint involvement is symmetrical and can affect multiple joints, including the DIP joints. Therefore, if a patient has a Heberden node, they may have Rheumatoid Arthritis, but not all patients with RA will necessarily have Heberden nodes."
Osteoarthritis of left knee joint,36717036,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is different from rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left knee joint does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Necrotizing vasculitis,4039691,True,"Yes, necrotizing vasculitis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Necrotizing vasculitis is a rare but serious complication of RA, where blood vessels become inflamed and damaged. This condition is not exclusive to RA, as it can also occur in other autoimmune diseases or infections. However, if a patient with RA develops necrotizing vasculitis, it is highly indicative of their underlying RA diagnosis. Therefore, if a patient has necrotizing vasculitis, they may or may not have RA, but if they have RA, they are likely to develop necrotizing vasculitis as a complication."
Vasculitis of the skin,4182711,False,"No

Rationale: Vasculitis of the skin is a condition that involves inflammation of blood vessels in the skin, which can present as palpable purpura, petechiae, or ulcers. While vasculitis can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to this malady. Vasculitis can occur in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, as well as infections and drug reactions. Therefore, having vasculitis of the skin does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Elbow pyogenic arthritis,4346971,True,"Yes, elbow pyogenic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic arthritis is a type of joint infection caused by bacteria, which can lead to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affects the synovial joints, including the elbow joint. Therefore, if a patient has elbow pyogenic arthritis, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Loose body in joint of ankle and/or foot,78509,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints with symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While a loose body in the joint of the ankle and/or foot can cause joint pain and swelling, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Loose bodies in joints are more commonly associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis or joint injuries. Therefore, the presence of a loose body in the joint of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of ankle and/or foot,46270470,False,"No.

Rationale:
Primary chronic gout without tophus of ankle and/or foot is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a metabolic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of acute inflammatory arthritis due to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and other tissues. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different etiologies, clinical presentations, and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of ankle and/or foot does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Ankylosis of joint of ankle AND/OR foot,80498,True,"Yes, ankylosis of the joint of the ankle and/or foot is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosis refers to the abnormal stiffening and immobility of a joint due to fusion of the bones, which can occur as a result of chronic inflammation and damage in conditions like RA. In RA, the chronic inflammation can lead to joint destruction and deformities, ultimately resulting in ankylosis of the affected joints. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosis of the joint of the ankle and/or foot, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of right knee joint,36713111,False,"No, osteoarthritis of the right knee joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While both osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis are types of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Osteoarthritis is primarily due to wear and tear on the joints over time, while Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right knee joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of knee,4065483,False,"No.

Rationale:
Reactive arthropathy of the knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy is a type of arthritis that occurs as a reaction to an infection in another part of the body, typically the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. It is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is primarily characterized by symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, particularly the small joints of the hands and feet. While knee involvement can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to this condition. Therefore, having reactive arthropathy of the knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of wrist,40483847,False,"No, infective arthritis of the wrist is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is a bacterial infection of the joint that can affect any joint in the body, including the wrist. It is characterized by joint pain, swelling, redness, and limited range of motion. The presence of a bacterial infection differentiates infective arthritis from autoimmune conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune disorder, infective arthritis is caused by a bacterial infection and requires prompt treatment with antibiotics. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the wrist does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the shoulder region,72984,True,"Yes, the condition of post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the shoulder region is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy is a type of reactive arthritis that occurs following an infection, such as dysentery. In this case, the arthropathy is specifically affecting the shoulder region. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, including the shoulder joint. 

Given that post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the shoulder region is a type of arthritis that affects the shoulder joint, it is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it fits within the spectrum of joint involvement seen in RA."
Infective arthritis of joint of hand,4177365,True,"Yes, infective arthritis of the joint of the hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is an infection of the joint that can cause symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, similar to those seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, infective arthritis is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder. 

Therefore, if a patient has infective arthritis of the joint of the hand, they definitely do not have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, if a patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis, they may or may not have infective arthritis of the joint of the hand."
Recurrent dislocation of ankle AND/OR foot,76783,False,"No, recurrent dislocation of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Recurrent dislocation of the ankle and/or foot is more commonly associated with ligamentous laxity or instability, previous injuries, or anatomical abnormalities rather than being a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint deformities and damage can occur in RA, recurrent dislocation is not a typical presenting symptom of the disease."
Chondrocalcinosis due to dicalcium phosphate crystals,437629,False,"No, chondrocalcinosis due to dicalcium phosphate crystals is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chondrocalcinosis is a condition characterized by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the cartilage, leading to joint pain and inflammation. While it can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having chondrocalcinosis due to dicalcium phosphate crystals does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Wrist pyogenic arthritis,4344398,True,"Yes, wrist pyogenic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic arthritis is a type of infectious arthritis caused by bacteria entering the joint space, leading to inflammation and joint damage. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the arthritis is primarily autoimmune in nature, not caused by an infection. Therefore, if a patient has wrist pyogenic arthritis, it is not necessarily indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, if a patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis, they may develop pyogenic arthritis as a complication of their autoimmune disease."
Lumbar arthritis,44783242,False,"No, lumbar arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Lumbar arthritis refers to arthritis affecting the lumbar spine, specifically the joints between the vertebrae. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints in the hands and feet, it can also affect other joints in the body, including the spine. However, lumbar arthritis can be caused by various types of arthritis, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having lumbar arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pyogenic arthritis of hand,72988,True,"Yes, pyogenic arthritis of the hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic arthritis is a bacterial infection of the joint, which can occur in patients with RA due to the compromised immune system and joint damage associated with the disease. Therefore, if a patient has pyogenic arthritis of the hand, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of ankle and/or foot caused by drug,46270453,False,"No.

Rationale:
Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they are two distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. While both conditions can affect the joints, the presence of gout of the ankle and/or foot caused by a drug does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings specific to RA would need to be considered for a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hemarthrosis of the ankle and/or foot,72403,True,"Yes, hemarthrosis of the ankle and/or foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hemarthrosis, which is bleeding into a joint, can occur in patients with RA due to the inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints characteristic of the disease. In RA, hemarthrosis can lead to joint swelling, pain, and stiffness, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, if a patient presents with hemarthrosis of the ankle and/or foot, it could be a strong indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of ankle and/or foot,44784341,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects synovial joints symmetrically, with polyarthritis involving multiple joints. Monoarthritis of the ankle and/or foot would not be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it only involves a single joint and does not meet the criteria for the characteristic symmetric polyarthritis seen in RA. While RA can affect the ankle and foot joints, the presence of monoarthritis in these areas alone would not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Other conditions such as gout, septic arthritis, or osteoarthritis could also present with monoarthritis in the ankle and/or foot."
Monoarthritis of joint of shoulder region,44782456,True,"Yes, monoarthritis of the joint of the shoulder region can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the shoulder. Monoarthritis of the shoulder in the context of RA may be a manifestation of the disease process, although it is less common than involvement of other joints such as the hands and feet. Additionally, the presence of other clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of RA in this case."
Subcutaneous rheumatoid nodule,4142899,True,"Yes, a subcutaneous rheumatoid nodule is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid nodules are a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis and are seen in approximately 20-30% of patients with the condition. These nodules are firm, non-tender, subcutaneous masses that typically develop over pressure points or areas of trauma. They are composed of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts and are considered a hallmark of RA. Therefore, if a patient has a subcutaneous rheumatoid nodule, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of temporomandibular joint,4240648,False,"No, arthritis of the temporomandibular joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet, arthritis of the temporomandibular joint specifically refers to arthritis in the jaw joint. This condition can be caused by various factors such as trauma, inflammation, or degenerative changes, and is not exclusive to RA. Therefore, having arthritis of the temporomandibular joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective polyarthritis,4266078,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while infective polyarthritis is a condition characterized by joint inflammation due to an infectious agent such as bacteria or viruses. While both conditions may present with polyarthritis (inflammation in multiple joints), they have different underlying causes. Therefore, having infective polyarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic rheumatic pericarditis,321307,False,"No, chronic rheumatic pericarditis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chronic rheumatic pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, which is typically caused by rheumatic fever rather than Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions involve inflammation, they affect different parts of the body and have distinct underlying causes."
Osteoarthritis of hip due to dysplasia,46273178,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis of the hip due to dysplasia is a specific condition that is different from Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions involve joint pain and inflammation, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Osteoarthritis of the hip due to dysplasia is primarily caused by abnormal hip joint development, leading to degeneration of the joint cartilage over time. In contrast, Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic inflammation and joint destruction. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the hip due to dysplasia does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of hip,46273639,False,"No

Rationale: Primary chronic gout without tophus of hip is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a metabolic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of acute inflammatory arthritis due to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and other tissues. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of hip does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Tuberculosis of knee,73122,False,"No, tuberculosis of the knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tuberculosis of the knee is a separate condition caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the knee joint, leading to symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different etiologies and require different treatment approaches. Therefore, having tuberculosis of the knee does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Wrist joint deformity,4198513,True,"Yes, wrist joint deformity is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint deformities are a common manifestation due to the chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints. Wrist joint deformities, such as ulnar deviation and swan-neck deformity, are classic findings in patients with RA. Therefore, if a person has wrist joint deformity, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Palindromic rheumatism of shoulder region,73568,False,"No, palindromic rheumatism of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Palindromic rheumatism is a rare form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent episodes of joint pain and swelling, typically affecting one joint at a time and resolving spontaneously within a few days. While some patients with palindromic rheumatism may go on to develop Rheumatoid Arthritis, the condition itself is not exclusive to RA and can also be seen in other types of arthritis or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, having palindromic rheumatism of the shoulder region does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Complication of reattached finger,442791,False,"No

Rationale: A complication of a reattached finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience complications related to joint damage and deformities, a complication of a reattached finger is not a defining characteristic of RA. It is important to consider the specific symptoms and diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis when assessing whether a condition is specific to this malady."
Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia,44783628,False,"No.

Rationale:
Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While pulmonary complications can occur in patients with RA, pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia can be caused by a variety of other conditions as well. Therefore, having pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bacterial arthritis of hip,4197765,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Bacterial arthritis of the hip, on the other hand, is a specific condition caused by an infection in the hip joint. While both conditions can present with joint pain and swelling, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having bacterial arthritis of the hip does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deformity of right foot,3655068,True,"Yes, deformity of the right foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction can lead to deformities in the hands and feet, particularly in the small joints. Deformities in the feet, such as bunions or claw toes, can be a common manifestation of RA. Therefore, if a patient has a deformity of the right foot, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of hand,44784338,True,"Yes, monoarthritis of the hand can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric, but monoarthritis of the hand can still be a presenting feature. RA commonly affects the small joints of the hands, and monoarthritis of the hand can be an early manifestation of the disease. Additionally, joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness are common symptoms of RA, which can be present in monoarthritis of the hand. Therefore, if a patient presents with monoarthritis of the hand, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Lesion of ligaments of foot region,4344519,False,"No

Rationale: A lesion of ligaments of the foot region is a specific condition that can occur due to various reasons such as trauma or overuse. While it may cause pain and swelling in the foot joints, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint destruction, and deformities. Therefore, having a lesion of ligaments of the foot region does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of knee,46270472,False,"No, primary chronic gout without tophus of knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and RA are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes and clinical presentations. Gout is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder. Additionally, gout typically affects the big toe joint initially, while RA often affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of knee does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Absent finger,4323582,False,"No, the condition of an absent finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint deformities, an absent finger is not a common symptom or characteristic of RA. An absent finger could be due to a congenital anomaly, trauma, surgical amputation, or other medical conditions unrelated to RA. Therefore, the presence of an absent finger does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cervical arthritis,4300489,False,"No, cervical arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Cervical arthritis refers to arthritis affecting the cervical spine, specifically the vertebrae in the neck. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect multiple joints in the body, including the cervical spine, cervical arthritis can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis or degenerative disc disease. Therefore, having cervical arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Palindromic rheumatism of hand,77641,True,"Yes, the condition of palindromic rheumatism of the hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Palindromic rheumatism is a rare form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent episodes of joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, typically affecting the small joints of the hands and feet. While not all patients with palindromic rheumatism will go on to develop Rheumatoid Arthritis, studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients with palindromic rheumatism will eventually progress to a diagnosis of RA. Therefore, if a patient presents with palindromic rheumatism of the hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Palindromic rheumatism of multiple sites,81945,True,"Yes, palindromic rheumatism of multiple sites can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Palindromic rheumatism is a rare form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent episodes of joint pain, swelling, and stiffness that resolve spontaneously within a few days. While palindromic rheumatism is not exclusive to Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is considered a precursor or early form of RA in some cases. Studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients with palindromic rheumatism eventually develop RA. Therefore, if a patient presents with palindromic rheumatism of multiple sites, it may indicate an increased risk of developing Rheumatoid Arthritis in the future."
Sclerodactyly,4308071,True,"Yes, sclerodactyly is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Sclerodactyly is a condition characterized by thickening and tightening of the skin on the fingers and toes, leading to a shiny and smooth appearance. It is a common manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, particularly in the later stages of the disease. The presence of sclerodactyly in a patient would strongly suggest the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a specific finding associated with this malady."
Gout of knee due to renal impairment,46270467,False,"No

Rationale:
Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It primarily affects the big toe but can also involve other joints such as the knee. Gout is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they are two distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. In this case, the presence of gout in the knee due to renal impairment does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of shoulder,4067054,False,"No

Rationale: Reactive arthropathy of the shoulder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy is a term used to describe joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In this case, the condition is localized to the shoulder joint and is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly in the hands and feet. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop reactive arthropathy of the shoulder, having reactive arthropathy of the shoulder does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of hip joint,4175848,False,"No

Rationale:
Monoarthritis of the hip joint refers to inflammation in a single hip joint, while Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. While monoarthritis of the hip joint can be a symptom of RA, it is not specific to RA as it can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis or septic arthritis. Therefore, having monoarthritis of the hip joint does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Allergic arthritis of the shoulder region,75042,False,"No, allergic arthritis of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Allergic arthritis typically refers to joint inflammation caused by an allergic reaction, which is different from the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint inflammation can occur in both conditions, the underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria are distinct. Therefore, having allergic arthritis of the shoulder region does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of right knee,37117135,True,"Yes, infective arthritis of the right knee is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is an infection in the joint that can cause symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, similar to those seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, infective arthritis is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease. Therefore, if a patient has infective arthritis of the right knee, they definitely do not have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Transient arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot,79905,False,"No

Rationale: Transient arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot is a temporary joint condition that may be caused by various factors such as injury, infection, or inflammation. While it may cause symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects multiple joints symmetrically and is characterized by specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings. Therefore, the presence of transient arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Monoarthritis of wrist,44784339,True,"Yes, monoarthritis of the wrist can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the wrist. Monoarthritis of the wrist in the context of RA would be consistent with the pattern of joint involvement seen in this condition. Additionally, the presence of joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness in the wrist would further support the association with RA. However, it is important to consider other potential causes of monoarthritis of the wrist, such as trauma or infection, and to confirm the diagnosis with appropriate clinical criteria and testing."
Pathological dislocation of ankle and/or foot,77956,False,"No

Rationale: Pathological dislocation of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint deformities and damage can occur in RA, pathological dislocation of the ankle and/or foot can be caused by various other conditions such as trauma, congenital abnormalities, or other forms of arthritis. Therefore, having a pathological dislocation of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left knee caused by bacteria,37108588,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition described, ""Arthritis of left knee caused by bacteria,"" specifically mentions an infection as the cause of arthritis in the left knee. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder and is not caused by a bacterial infection. While RA can affect the knee joint, the specific cause mentioned in the condition is not consistent with the pathophysiology of RA. Therefore, having arthritis in the left knee caused by bacteria does not necessarily mean that the individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of left knee,37108589,False,"No

Rationale:
Infective arthritis of the left knee is a specific condition that involves an infection in the knee joint. While it may present with similar symptoms such as joint swelling and tenderness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder, whereas infective arthritis is caused by an infection. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the left knee does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Monoarthritis of elbow,44784340,True,"Yes, monoarthritis of the elbow can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the elbow. Monoarthritis of the elbow in the context of RA may be a manifestation of the disease process, as RA can present with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction in various joints. Additionally, the presence of other clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings consistent with RA would further support the association between monoarthritis of the elbow and Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Herpes gestationis,4311256,False,"No, herpes gestationis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Herpes gestationis, also known as pemphigoid gestationis, is a rare autoimmune skin disorder that occurs during pregnancy or postpartum. It is characterized by the development of itchy, blistering skin lesions that typically start in the abdomen and spread to other parts of the body. While both conditions are autoimmune in nature, they affect different systems in the body (skin vs. joints) and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having herpes gestationis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Post-infective arthritis of joint of hand,4313176,False,"No, post-infective arthritis of the joint of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Post-infective arthritis refers to arthritis that develops after an infection in the joint, which can be caused by various organisms such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi. While Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, post-infective arthritis is a result of an infection. Therefore, having post-infective arthritis of the joint of the hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infection causing spondyloarthritis,36715561,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Infection causing spondyloarthritis, on the other hand, is a different condition that involves inflammation of the spine and joints. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Therefore, having an infection causing spondyloarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Crystal arthropathy of ankle AND/OR foot,73287,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While crystal arthropathy, such as gout or pseudogout, can also affect the joints, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Crystal arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot may present with acute inflammatory arthritis due to the deposition of crystals in the joint, leading to pain, swelling, and redness. Therefore, having crystal arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovitis of hip,4002793,True,"Yes, synovitis of the hip can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joint, which is a characteristic feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is a key component of the disease process, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient has synovitis of the hip, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a common manifestation of the disease."
Arthropathy of the shoulder region associated with helminthiasis,74120,False,"No

Rationale: Arthropathy of the shoulder region associated with helminthiasis is a specific condition related to a parasitic infection, while Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. There is no direct correlation between the two, so having arthropathy of the shoulder region associated with helminthiasis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis,4025168,False,"No.

Rationale:
Diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is a condition affecting the lungs characterized by scarring and thickening of the lung tissue. While pulmonary involvement can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. It can be seen in various other conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, connective tissue diseases, environmental exposures, and certain medications. Therefore, having diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Gout of hand caused by drug,46270455,False,"No

Rationale: Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It primarily affects the big toe but can also involve other joints, including the hands. Gout is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they are two distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune disease, gout is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. Therefore, having gout of the hand caused by a drug does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of right glenohumeral joint,759879,False,"No, osteoarthritis of the right glenohumeral joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disorder like RA. While both conditions can affect joints and cause pain, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right glenohumeral joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of joint of right shoulder region,36713103,False,"No.

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right shoulder region does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic crepitant synovitis of hand and wrist,4002155,True,"Yes, chronic crepitant synovitis of hand and wrist is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Crepitant synovitis refers to the presence of a crackling or popping sensation within a joint, which is often associated with inflammation of the synovial membrane. In the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, chronic crepitant synovitis of the hand and wrist is a common manifestation due to the inflammatory process affecting the synovial joints. This condition is a hallmark feature of RA and is often seen in conjunction with other symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. Therefore, if a patient presents with chronic crepitant synovitis of the hand and wrist, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of the ankle and/or foot,4116008,False,"No

Rationale: Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gouty arthritis can affect the ankle and foot joints, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by autoimmune inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints, with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings used for diagnosis. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of right shoulder,761506,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the right shoulder can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the shoulders. The presence of arthropathy in the right shoulder could be indicative of RA, especially if other joints are also affected. Additionally, RA is known to cause joint destruction and deformities, which can manifest as arthropathy in the shoulder joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy of the right shoulder, it is possible that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of hand,46270471,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints with characteristic joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. It is an autoimmune disease characterized by symmetric polyarthritis. On the other hand, primary chronic gout without tophus of the hand is a condition related to the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, redness, and swelling. While both conditions involve joint symptoms, they have different underlying causes and pathophysiology. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of the hand does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Lipoid dermatoarthritis,4224167,False,"No.

Rationale:
Lipoid dermatoarthritis is not a recognized medical condition or term in the context of rheumatoid arthritis or any other known medical condition. Therefore, it cannot be considered specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Gout of hip caused by drug,46270456,False,"No

Rationale:
Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, most commonly the big toe. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they are two distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Gout of the hip caused by a drug is a specific condition related to medication-induced gout affecting the hip joint, which is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having gout of the hip caused by a drug does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot,81373,True,"Yes, the condition of post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy is a condition that can occur following an episode of dysentery, which is an infection of the intestines that results in diarrhea containing blood or mucus. This condition can lead to joint inflammation, particularly in the ankle and foot joints. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition of post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot can be a manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it involves joint inflammation and can be a result of an autoimmune response. Therefore, if a person has post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot, they may definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Climacteric arthritis of the shoulder region,81938,False,"No

Rationale: Climacteric arthritis of the shoulder region is a specific condition related to menopausal hormonal changes that can cause shoulder pain and stiffness. While it may present with similar symptoms to rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA and can be caused by other factors such as hormonal changes. Therefore, having climacteric arthritis of the shoulder region does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Bouchard's node,4066493,True,"Yes, Bouchard's node is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Bouchard's nodes are bony enlargements that develop on the middle joints of the fingers in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. These nodes are a characteristic feature of RA and are not typically seen in other forms of arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has Bouchard's nodes, they are likely to have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of elbow,46273638,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. It is an autoimmune disease characterized by specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings. 

Primary chronic gout without tophus of elbow, on the other hand, is a condition characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to acute inflammatory arthritis. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of elbow does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of hip,4065482,False,"No, reactive arthropathy of the hip is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy is a term used to describe joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. It is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings. While joint inflammation can occur in both conditions, reactive arthropathy of the hip is not a specific indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of shoulder,46273523,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. It is an autoimmune disease characterized by specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings. 

Primary chronic gout without tophus of shoulder, on the other hand, is a condition characterized by recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis due to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and other tissues. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of shoulder does not necessarily mean that an individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of hand due to renal impairment,46270465,False,"No

Rationale: Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It primarily affects the big toe but can also involve other joints, including the hands. Gout is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they are two distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Gout is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, while Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints. Additionally, the presence of renal impairment in this condition suggests a different etiology than Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of knee caused by drug,46270457,False,"No

Rationale: Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, commonly affecting the big toe. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they are two distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Gout is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, leading to the formation of crystals in the joints, while Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. Additionally, the presence of gout in the knee caused by a drug is a specific scenario that does not necessarily indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Polyarthritis associated with another disorder,4265764,True,"Yes, polyarthritis associated with another disorder can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Polyarthritis, which is the inflammation of multiple joints, is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, polyarthritis is typically symmetric and involves small joints like those in the hands and feet. Additionally, the description of RA mentions that it is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are also features of polyarthritis. 

Therefore, if a patient presents with polyarthritis associated with another disorder, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as the symptoms align with the clinical criteria for RA. However, it is important to consider other factors such as serological markers and imaging findings to confirm the diagnosis of RA."
Allergic arthritis of the hand,77070,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Allergic arthritis of the hand, on the other hand, suggests an allergic reaction affecting the joints in the hand. While allergies can sometimes trigger inflammatory responses in the joints, it is not a specific condition associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having allergic arthritis of the hand does not definitively mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of elbow caused by drug,46270454,False,"No, gout of the elbow caused by a drug is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and RA are forms of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints. Additionally, gout typically affects larger joints such as the big toe, whereas RA primarily affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, the presence of gout of the elbow caused by a drug does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deformity of left foot,3655067,True,"Yes, deformity of the left foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction can lead to deformities in the hands and feet, particularly in the small joints. Deformities in the feet, such as bunions or claw toes, can be a common manifestation of RA. Therefore, if a patient has a deformity of the left foot, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Periarthritis of wrist,4009506,False,"No

Rationale: Periarthritis of the wrist is a condition that involves inflammation of the tissues surrounding the wrist joint, such as the tendons and ligaments. While it may cause symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Periarthritis of the wrist can be caused by various factors such as overuse, injury, or underlying medical conditions like arthritis, but it does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Additional diagnostic criteria, such as serological markers and imaging findings, would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in a patient presenting with periarthritis of the wrist."
Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the shoulder region,81656,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described, arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the shoulder region, specifically refers to joint involvement in Behcet's syndrome, which is a separate autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions, and uveitis. While joint involvement can occur in Behcet's syndrome, it is not a defining feature of the condition. Therefore, having arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the shoulder region does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Developmental dislocation of ankle and/or foot,40483729,False,"No, the condition of developmental dislocation of ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Developmental dislocation of the ankle and/or foot is a musculoskeletal condition involving the abnormal positioning of the ankle and/or foot joints due to developmental factors. It is not a characteristic symptom or feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints with symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having developmental dislocation of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of elbow due to renal impairment,46270464,False,"No

Rationale:
Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While gout can occur in various joints, including the elbow, it is not a defining characteristic of RA. Additionally, the presence of renal impairment as a cause of gout in the elbow suggests a different underlying etiology than RA, which is primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, the condition of ""Gout of elbow due to renal impairment"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Recurrent dislocation of interphalangeal joint,4117253,False,"No

Rationale: Recurrent dislocation of the interphalangeal joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint deformities and functional impairment are common in RA, recurrent dislocation of the interphalangeal joint can be caused by various factors such as trauma, ligament laxity, or other underlying joint conditions. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of elbow,4067299,False,"No, reactive arthropathy of the elbow is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy is a term used to describe joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In this case, the condition is localized to the elbow joint and is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints in a symmetric pattern. While joint inflammation can be a symptom of RA, the specific location and nature of the reactive arthropathy in the elbow do not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in this case."
Injury of articular cartilage of left knee joint,36686378,False,"No

Rationale: An injury of the articular cartilage of the left knee joint is a specific condition related to a physical injury to the knee joint, rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint injuries can potentially lead to the development of arthritis in the affected joint over time, the presence of an injury to the articular cartilage of the left knee joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Injury of articular cartilage of right knee joint,36686377,False,"No

Rationale: An injury of articular cartilage of the right knee joint is a specific condition related to damage to the cartilage in the knee joint, which can be caused by trauma or wear and tear. While this condition may cause symptoms similar to those seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and the presence of an injury to the articular cartilage of the right knee joint does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Stress fracture of lateral condyle of left femur,759834,False,"No.

Rationale:
A stress fracture of the lateral condyle of the left femur is a specific injury to the bone, typically caused by repetitive stress or overuse. It is not a symptom or characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may be at increased risk for fractures due to factors such as osteoporosis or chronic inflammation, a stress fracture of the femur is not a direct manifestation of RA itself."
Osteoarthritis of finger joint,4343918,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis of the finger joint is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis can affect the joints, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and characteristics. Osteoarthritis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis, as it is a separate condition that is not autoimmune in nature and does not involve the systemic inflammation and joint destruction seen in RA. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the finger joint does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Pyogenic bacterial arthritis of knee,761892,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the knee is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic bacterial arthritis is a type of infectious arthritis caused by bacteria entering the joint space, leading to inflammation and joint damage. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the primary cause is autoimmune inflammation rather than a bacterial infection. Therefore, if a patient has pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the knee, they definitely do not have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of joint of left shoulder region,759883,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of joint of left shoulder region"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition ""Arthritis of joint of left shoulder region"" specifically mentions arthritis in the left shoulder joint, which is consistent with the joint involvement seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the left shoulder region, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of joints of bilateral shoulder regions,759886,True,"Yes, the condition of inflammation of joints of bilateral shoulder regions is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, meaning that it affects joints on both sides of the body. Inflammation of joints in the shoulder regions is a common manifestation of RA, along with joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness. Therefore, if a person has inflammation of joints in both shoulder regions, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as a potential underlying cause."
Synovitis of elbow,4079737,True,"Yes, synovitis of the elbow can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis, which is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, is a common feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is typically symmetric and affects multiple joints, including the elbows. Therefore, if a patient presents with synovitis of the elbow, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis, especially when considered in conjunction with other clinical criteria such as joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings."
Juvenile spondyloarthropathy,4079735,False,"No, juvenile spondyloarthropathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile spondyloarthropathy is a group of inflammatory diseases that primarily affect the spine and large joints, and it can also involve the skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract. While there may be some overlap in symptoms with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having juvenile spondyloarthropathy does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Early onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis,4079732,True,"Yes, early onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Early onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis refers to a type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) that affects fewer than five joints in the first six months of disease onset. This condition is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis because it falls under the umbrella of autoimmune inflammatory disorders that primarily affect the synovial joints, similar to RA. Additionally, the symptoms of early onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis, such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness, overlap with those of RA. Therefore, if a person has early onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis,4079733,False,"No, juvenile psoriatic arthritis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Juvenile psoriatic arthritis is a type of arthritis that affects children and adolescents with psoriasis, a skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and clinical features. Juvenile psoriatic arthritis is associated with psoriasis, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having juvenile psoriatic arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Partial failure replanted fingers,4309010,False,"No

Rationale: The condition of partial failure of replanted fingers is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition refers to a surgical procedure where a severed finger is reattached to the hand. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can lead to joint deformities and functional impairment, the specific condition of partial failure of replanted fingers is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Pyogenic bacterial arthritis of foot,761944,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the foot is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic bacterial arthritis is a type of infectious arthritis caused by bacteria entering the joint space, leading to inflammation and joint damage. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are at an increased risk of developing infections, including pyogenic bacterial arthritis, due to their compromised immune system and the chronic inflammation associated with RA. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops pyogenic bacterial arthritis in the foot, it is highly likely that it is a complication of their underlying RA."
Total failure replanted finger,4309014,False,"No

Rationale: A total failure of a replanted finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can lead to joint deformities and functional impairment, a total failure of a replanted finger is a specific event related to a surgical procedure rather than a symptom or sign of RA. It is important to consider other factors and medical history when assessing the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right hip,759890,False,"No, arthritis of the right hip is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including the hips, arthritis of the right hip can be caused by various conditions, including osteoarthritis, traumatic injury, or other inflammatory conditions. A diagnosis of RA would require additional criteria such as symmetric polyarthritis, serological markers, and imaging findings, which are not necessarily present in a case of arthritis of the right hip."
Synovial osteochondromatosis of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger,4067425,False,"No

Rationale: Synovial osteochondromatosis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger is a benign condition characterized by the formation of multiple cartilaginous nodules within the synovial lining of joints. While this condition may cause joint swelling and stiffness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having synovial osteochondromatosis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Photodermatitis co-occurrent and due to autoimmune disease,42537710,True,"Yes, photodermatitis co-occurring and due to an autoimmune disease could be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Photodermatitis is a condition where the skin becomes inflamed and irritated after exposure to sunlight. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, photosensitivity can be a symptom due to the autoimmune nature of the disease. Therefore, if a patient has photodermatitis co-occurring and due to an autoimmune disease, it could be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of hand due to viral infection,4178008,False,"No, arthritis of the hand due to a viral infection is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and presents with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, arthritis of the hand due to a viral infection is a different condition caused by a viral pathogen. The symptoms and underlying cause of these two conditions are distinct, making arthritis of the hand due to a viral infection not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pyogenic bacterial arthritis of wrist,761982,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the wrist is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic bacterial arthritis is an infection of the joint caused by bacteria, leading to symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. These symptoms can mimic those of Rheumatoid Arthritis, making it difficult to differentiate between the two conditions without proper evaluation. Additionally, both conditions can present with joint pain and morning stiffness. Therefore, if a patient has pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the wrist, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis, but having Rheumatoid Arthritis does not necessarily mean they have pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the wrist."
Infective arthritis of interphalangeal joint of toe,40489491,False,"No, the condition ""Infective arthritis of interphalangeal joint of toe"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis refers to a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection of a joint, which can cause symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and redness. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and presents with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, it is an autoimmune disease and not typically caused by an infection. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the interphalangeal joint of the toe does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Fibroblastic rheumatism,4266181,False,"No, fibroblastic rheumatism is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Fibroblastic rheumatism is a rare condition characterized by skin nodules and joint contractures, which is distinct from the typical presentation of Rheumatoid Arthritis involving synovial joint inflammation and destruction. While both conditions may involve joint symptoms, the underlying pathophysiology and clinical features are different, making fibroblastic rheumatism not a specific indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cyst of finger,4335814,False,"No, a cyst of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A cyst of the finger is a fluid-filled sac that can develop in the tissues of the fingers, typically near a joint or tendon. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint deformities, the presence of a cyst of the finger does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other factors such as joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings to diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral wrist osteoarthritis,36684458,False,"No, bilateral wrist osteoarthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While wrist involvement can occur in RA, bilateral wrist osteoarthritis is more commonly associated with osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetrical and affects multiple joints, not just the wrists. Additionally, the presence of osteoarthritis does not definitively indicate the presence of RA, as they are distinct conditions with different underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria."
Osteoarthritis of joint of bilateral hands,36684457,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is different from rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can affect the hands, the specific characteristics of joint involvement, inflammation, and systemic autoimmune nature of rheumatoid arthritis differentiate it from osteoarthritis. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the joint of bilateral hands does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Bilateral osteoarthritis of knees,36684454,False,"No

Rationale: Bilateral osteoarthritis of the knees is a specific condition that refers to degenerative joint disease affecting both knees. While osteoarthritis can cause joint pain, stiffness, and swelling similar to rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of bilateral osteoarthritis of the knees does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a distinct autoimmune inflammatory disorder with specific diagnostic criteria, including serological markers and imaging findings, that differentiate it from osteoarthritis. Therefore, having bilateral osteoarthritis of the knees does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Autoimmune keratitis,36717242,False,"No

Rationale: Autoimmune keratitis is a condition that involves inflammation of the cornea due to an autoimmune response. While autoimmune conditions can sometimes be associated with each other, autoimmune keratitis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having autoimmune keratitis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis",4253902,True,"Yes, Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that primarily affects the entheses, which are the sites where tendons and ligaments attach to bones. While it shares some similarities with Rheumatoid Arthritis, such as joint inflammation and pain, it is a distinct condition with its own diagnostic criteria and treatment approach. Therefore, if a patient has been diagnosed with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis, they do not definitively have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic polyarthritis,3168431,True,"Yes, chronic polyarthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chronic polyarthritis, which is the presence of inflammation in multiple joints over a long period of time, is a key feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, the inflammation is autoimmune in nature and leads to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are all characteristic of chronic polyarthritis. Therefore, if a person has chronic polyarthritis, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital absence of soft tissue of distal phalanx of finger,764073,False,"No, the condition of congenital absence of soft tissue of the distal phalanx of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition refers to a congenital anomaly affecting the soft tissue of the finger, which is not a characteristic feature of RA. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints with symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, rather than soft tissue abnormalities in the fingers. Therefore, having this specific condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Abscess of tendon sheath of right ankle AND/OR foot,764072,False,"No

Abscess of tendon sheath of right ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, an abscess of the tendon sheath is a localized infection that can occur in any individual, regardless of whether they have RA or not. The presence of an abscess of the tendon sheath does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of left hip joint,36713109,False,"No, osteoarthritis of the left hip joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone changes. It is not an autoimmune disorder like RA. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and treatment approaches. Osteoarthritis is more commonly associated with aging and wear and tear on the joints, whereas RA is an autoimmune condition. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left hip joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Laxity of ligaments of foot,4344036,False,"No

Rationale: Laxity of ligaments of the foot is a condition that can occur in various situations, such as in individuals with hypermobility syndromes or previous injuries. While it may be present in some individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the chronic inflammatory nature of the disease affecting joint structures, it is not specific to RA. Therefore, having laxity of ligaments of the foot does not definitively mean that an individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Villous arthritis of hand,764076,False,"No

Rationale: Villous arthritis of the hand is not a specific condition associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Villous arthritis of the hand is not a commonly recognized term in the medical literature and does not specifically point to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle,4176016,True,"Yes, arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Behcet's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis that can affect multiple organ systems, including the joints. Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome can present similarly to RA with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. However, the key difference is that Behcet's syndrome is not primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints like RA. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle, they may or may not have RA, but if they have RA, they do not necessarily have Behcet's syndrome."
Discoid meniscus of right knee,764093,False,"No

Rationale: A discoid meniscus of the right knee is a structural abnormality of the knee joint where the meniscus is abnormally shaped, often larger and thicker than usual. While this condition can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and clicking in the knee joint, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by autoimmune inflammation, joint destruction, and deformities. Therefore, having a discoid meniscus of the right knee does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Discoid meniscus of left knee,764092,False,"No

Rationale:
A discoid meniscus of the left knee is a structural abnormality of the knee joint where the meniscus is abnormally shaped and larger than usual. While this condition can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and clicking in the knee joint, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and destruction. Therefore, having a discoid meniscus of the left knee does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of left elbow due to gout,36684527,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described, arthritis of the left elbow due to gout, specifically mentions gout as the cause of arthritis in the left elbow, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. Therefore, the presence of arthritis in the left elbow due to gout does not necessarily indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of left ankle,36684526,False,"No.

Rationale:
Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. While both gouty arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are types of arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and characteristics. Gouty arthritis is caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the left ankle does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Pyogenic arthritis of hip,4188413,True,"Yes, pyogenic arthritis of the hip is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Pyogenic arthritis of the hip refers to a bacterial infection of the hip joint, leading to inflammation and symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. While these symptoms can overlap with those of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), the key difference is the underlying cause. Pyogenic arthritis of the hip is caused by a bacterial infection, whereas RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Therefore, if a patient has pyogenic arthritis of the hip, they definitely do not have RA. However, if a patient has RA, they may or may not have pyogenic arthritis of the hip as well, as RA primarily affects the synovial joints and can coexist with other joint conditions."
Monoarthritis of joint of right hand,36684543,True,"Yes, the condition of monoarthritis of the joint of the right hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, meaning that it typically affects multiple joints on both sides of the body. However, monoarthritis (involvement of only one joint) can still be a manifestation of RA, especially in the early stages of the disease. Additionally, the fact that the condition specifically mentions the joint of the right hand aligns with the description of RA, which often presents with joint pain and swelling in the small joints of the hands. Therefore, if a patient has monoarthritis of the joint of the right hand, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of joint of right ankle,36684542,False,"No

Rationale: Rheumatoid Arthritis typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, particularly in the hands and feet. Monoarthritis of the right ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis as it only involves one joint and does not meet the criteria for the characteristic pattern of joint involvement seen in RA. Other conditions such as gout, septic arthritis, or trauma could also present with monoarthritis of the right ankle."
Monoarthritis of left knee,36684541,False,"No

Rationale: Rheumatoid Arthritis typically presents as symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, particularly the small joints of the hands and feet. Monoarthritis of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis as it only involves one joint and does not meet the criteria for the characteristic pattern of joint involvement seen in RA. While RA can affect the knee joint, monoarthritis of the left knee alone is not enough to definitively diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of RA in this case."
Monoarthritis of joint of left hand,36684540,True,"Yes, the condition of monoarthritis of the joint of the left hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, meaning that it typically affects multiple joints on both sides of the body. Monoarthritis, which refers to inflammation in a single joint, is less common in RA. However, RA can still present with monoarthritis, especially in the early stages of the disease. Additionally, the involvement of the small joints of the hands is a common feature of RA, making monoarthritis of the joint of the left hand a possible manifestation of this condition. 

Therefore, if a patient presents with monoarthritis of the joint of the left hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of joint of left ankle,36684539,False,"No

Rationale: Rheumatoid Arthritis typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, particularly in the hands and feet. Monoarthritis of the left ankle would not be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it only involves one joint and does not meet the criteria for the characteristic joint involvement seen in RA. Other conditions such as gout, septic arthritis, or trauma could also present with monoarthritis of the left ankle."
Arthritis of right wrist due to gout,36684535,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, ""Arthritis of right wrist due to gout,"" specifically mentions gout as the cause of arthritis in the right wrist. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, typically affecting the big toe. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a separate autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, with a different pathophysiology and presentation. While both conditions can cause arthritis, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes. Therefore, having arthritis in the right wrist due to gout does not necessarily mean that a person has RA."
Gouty arthritis of right knee,36684534,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Gouty arthritis, on the other hand, is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the right knee does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of right hand,36684533,False,"No

Rationale: Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gouty arthritis can affect the hands, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by autoimmune inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints, with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings used for diagnosis. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the right hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right elbow due to gout,36684532,False,"No, arthritis of the right elbow due to gout is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints with characteristic features such as symmetric polyarthritis, joint swelling, and morning stiffness. The presence of arthritis in the right elbow due to gout does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteochondritis of metacarpal,4079842,False,"No, osteochondritis of the metacarpal is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteochondritis is a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the bone and cartilage in a joint, typically affecting the knees, ankles, and elbows. While joint involvement is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, osteochondritis specifically refers to a different type of joint pathology that is not unique to RA. Therefore, having osteochondritis of the metacarpal does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of lesser metatarsophalangeal joint,4067554,False,"No, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of lesser metatarsophalangeal joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy refers to joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition. In this case, the involvement of the lesser metatarsophalangeal joint suggests a different etiology than RA, which primarily affects the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. Additionally, the term ""reactive"" implies a secondary response to an external trigger, rather than the primary autoimmune nature of RA. Therefore, having reactive arthropathy of the lesser metatarsophalangeal joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of right ankle,36684531,False,"No.

Rationale:
Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and swelling, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Gouty arthritis is caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the right ankle does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left wrist due to gout,36684530,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, ""Arthritis of left wrist due to gout,"" specifically mentions gout as the cause of arthritis in the left wrist. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a distinct autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While both conditions involve arthritis, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having arthritis of the left wrist due to gout does not necessarily mean that the individual has RA."
Gouty arthritis of left knee,36684529,False,"No, gouty arthritis of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gouty arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It is not typically associated with the autoimmune mechanisms seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and swelling, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the left knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of left hand,36684528,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Gouty arthritis, on the other hand, is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the left hand does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ingrowing fingernail (excluding thumb),4063453,False,"No

Rationale: An ingrowing fingernail is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may experience joint pain and swelling in the small joints of the hands, an ingrowing fingernail is a separate condition that is not directly related to RA. It is important to consider other factors such as trauma, improper nail care, or infection as potential causes of an ingrowing fingernail."
Ankylosis of joint of finger,4323490,True,"Yes, ankylosis of a joint of the finger is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosis refers to the abnormal stiffening and immobility of a joint due to fusion of the bones, which can occur in advanced stages of RA as a result of joint destruction and deformities. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosis of a joint of the finger, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of subtalar joint,4065484,False,"No, reactive arthropathy of the subtalar joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy is a term used to describe joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In this case, it is specifically affecting the subtalar joint. While joint inflammation can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, reactive arthropathy of the subtalar joint is not a defining characteristic of RA. It is important to consider other factors and diagnostic criteria when assessing for Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Neuropathic spondylopathy,4067532,False,"No, neuropathic spondylopathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Neuropathic spondylopathy refers to a condition affecting the spine characterized by nerve damage or dysfunction, which can result in symptoms such as pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience neuropathic symptoms due to nerve compression or inflammation in the spine, neuropathic spondylopathy can also be caused by other conditions such as diabetes, spinal cord injury, or infections. Therefore, the presence of neuropathic spondylopathy does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of talonavicular joint,4065485,False,"No.

Rationale:
Reactive arthropathy of the talonavicular joint is a specific condition affecting the talonavicular joint, which is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet, the talonavicular joint is not typically involved in RA. Therefore, having reactive arthropathy of the talonavicular joint does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, undifferentiated arthritis",4257972,True,"Yes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, undifferentiated arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and undifferentiated arthritis are conditions that fall under the umbrella of arthritis, which is a broad term encompassing various inflammatory conditions affecting the joints. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a specific type of arthritis characterized by autoimmune inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints. JIA and undifferentiated arthritis can present with similar symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, which are also common in RA. However, the specific criteria for diagnosing RA, including symmetric polyarthritis, serological markers, and imaging findings, are not typically present in JIA or undifferentiated arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has been diagnosed with JIA or undifferentiated arthritis, they may or may not have RA, but if they have RA, they would not be diagnosed with JIA or undifferentiated arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of metacarpophalangeal joint,4065480,True,"Yes, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of metacarpophalangeal joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by joint involvement, including the metacarpophalangeal joints, which are commonly affected in this condition. The term ""reactive arthropathy"" suggests an inflammatory reaction in the joint, which is a key feature of RA. Therefore, if a patient has reactive arthropathy of the metacarpophalangeal joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of distal interphalangeal joint of finger,4065481,False,"No

Rationale: While reactive arthropathy of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger can present with joint symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Reactive arthropathy can be caused by various factors such as infection or trauma, whereas RA is a specific autoimmune disorder with distinct diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having reactive arthropathy of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Immunoglobulin G4 related disease,36717255,False,"No, Immunoglobulin G4 related disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Immunoglobulin G4 related disease is a chronic immune-mediated condition characterized by tissue infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells, fibrosis, and tumefactive lesions in various organs. While both conditions involve autoimmune processes, they affect different organs and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having Immunoglobulin G4 related disease does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of wrist,4065479,False,"No.

Rationale: Reactive arthropathy of the wrist is a condition characterized by inflammation and swelling of the joints in response to an infection or other trigger. While it may present with similar symptoms to rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Reactive arthropathy of the wrist can be caused by various factors such as infections, trauma, or other inflammatory conditions, and does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA. Therefore, having reactive arthropathy of the wrist does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Effusion of joint of left knee,36684501,True,"Yes, effusion of the joint of the left knee can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Effusion, or swelling, of the joint is a common symptom of RA due to the inflammation and synovitis that occurs in the disease. In RA, the synovial lining of the joint becomes inflamed and produces excess fluid, leading to joint swelling and effusion. Therefore, if a patient presents with effusion of the joint of the left knee, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, it is important to consider other factors such as clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings for a definitive diagnosis of RA."
Finding of subtalar joint,4104503,False,"No, the condition ""Finding of subtalar joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. The finding of subtalar joint refers to an observation or imaging result related to the subtalar joint, which is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly the small joints of the hands and feet, and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While RA can affect multiple joints in the body, the presence of a finding in the subtalar joint alone does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings specific to RA would need to be considered for a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acquired varus deformity of right knee,36684604,False,"No

Rationale: An acquired varus deformity of the right knee is a specific physical finding related to the alignment of the knee joint, which can be caused by various factors such as trauma, osteoarthritis, or previous surgeries. While rheumatoid arthritis can lead to joint deformities, it typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, not just the right knee. Therefore, the presence of an acquired varus deformity of the right knee does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Acquired varus deformity of left knee,36684601,False,"No, acquired varus deformity of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Varus deformity of the knee refers to a condition where the knee joint is angled inward, leading to bow-legged appearance. While joint deformities can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint destruction, varus deformity of the knee is not a defining characteristic of RA. It can be caused by various other conditions such as osteoarthritis, trauma, or congenital abnormalities. Therefore, the presence of acquired varus deformity of the left knee does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of right knee,36684544,False,"No

Rationale: While monoarthritis of the right knee can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to this malady. Monoarthritis (inflammation of a single joint) can be caused by various conditions such as trauma, infection, gout, or other forms of arthritis. Therefore, having monoarthritis of the right knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acquired deformity of right finger,762173,False,"No, the condition ""Acquired deformity of right finger"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can lead to joint deformities in the fingers, there are many other potential causes of acquired finger deformities, such as trauma, osteoarthritis, or other inflammatory conditions. Therefore, having an acquired deformity of the right finger does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to determine the underlying cause of the finger deformity."
Derangement of medial meniscus of right knee,762162,False,"No, the condition ""Derangement of medial meniscus of right knee"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. The derangement of the medial meniscus of the right knee refers to a specific injury or issue with the knee joint, which is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling in various joints, including the knees, the presence of a specific knee injury does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune retinopathy,37110540,False,"No, autoimmune retinopathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Autoimmune retinopathy is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the retina of the eye, leading to progressive vision loss. While autoimmune diseases like RA can have ocular manifestations, autoimmune retinopathy is not a defining feature of RA. Therefore, having autoimmune retinopathy does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Derangement of medial meniscus of left knee,762161,False,"No, the condition ""Derangement of medial meniscus of left knee"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition of derangement of the medial meniscus of the left knee refers to a specific injury or issue with the cartilage in the knee joint, which is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have issues with their knee cartilage, the presence of a medial meniscus derangement does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of right foot,37108592,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Gouty arthritis, on the other hand, is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both conditions can affect joints, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the right foot does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of right great toe,37108593,True,"Yes, the condition of gouty arthritis of the right great toe is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gouty arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gout and RA are both forms of arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and manifestations. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the right great toe does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic manifestations,37204863,False,"No, the condition ""Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic manifestations"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition is actually associated with a rare genetic disorder known as Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). CADASIL is characterized by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, leading to abnormalities in the small blood vessels in the brain and other organs. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the joints, CADASIL primarily affects the brain and blood vessels. Therefore, having the condition does not necessarily mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of left hand,762178,True,"Yes, the condition ""Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of left hand"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a type of arthritis that affects children, and it can present with symptoms similar to those seen in adult RA, such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints, including the glenohumeral joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the left glenohumeral joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of right hand,762180,True,"Yes, the condition ""Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of right hand"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a type of arthritis that affects children, and it can present with symptoms similar to those seen in adult RA, such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. The fact that the condition specifically mentions arthritis of the right hand, which is a common site of involvement in RA, further supports the connection. Additionally, the term ""idiopathic"" suggests that the cause of the arthritis is unknown, which aligns with the autoimmune nature of RA. Therefore, if a person has been diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis of the right hand, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of right foot due to trauma,37108601,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the joints and cause pain, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right foot due to trauma does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right shoulder caused by bacteria,37108583,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition described, ""Arthritis of right shoulder caused by bacteria,"" is specific to an infectious cause of arthritis, which is not characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and it is not caused by a bacterial infection. Therefore, having arthritis of the right shoulder caused by bacteria does not necessarily mean that a person has RA."
Retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy,45765600,False,"No, retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy is a rare genetic disorder that affects the blood vessels in the retina, inner ear, and brain.

While osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In contrast to RA, osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disease and does not involve the systemic inflammation and joint destruction seen in RA. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the foot joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Myocarditis due to autoimmune disease,3656114,True,"Yes, myocarditis due to autoimmune disease can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease, meaning it can affect various organs and tissues in the body, including the heart. Myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle, can occur as a complication of Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the autoimmune response affecting the heart. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops myocarditis due to autoimmune disease, it is likely specific to their underlying condition of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Effusion of right knee joint,762253,True,"Yes, effusion of the right knee joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Effusion, or swelling, of the joints is a common symptom of RA due to the inflammation and synovial fluid accumulation in the affected joints. In RA, the synovial lining of the joints becomes inflamed, leading to increased production of synovial fluid and subsequent joint swelling. Therefore, if a patient presents with effusion of the right knee joint, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis, especially when considered in conjunction with other symptoms such as morning stiffness, joint pain, and tenderness. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of knee effusion, such as trauma or infection, and to confirm the diagnosis of RA through clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings."
Aseptic necrosis of right medial femoral condyle,37108670,True,"Yes, aseptic necrosis of the right medial femoral condyle can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Aseptic necrosis, also known as avascular necrosis, is a condition where there is a loss of blood supply to a bone, leading to bone death. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic inflammation and destruction of joints can lead to aseptic necrosis in various joints, including the femoral condyles. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops aseptic necrosis in the right medial femoral condyle, it is likely a manifestation of their underlying RA."
Aseptic necrosis of left medial femoral condyle,37108671,True,"Yes, aseptic necrosis of the left medial femoral condyle can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Aseptic necrosis, also known as avascular necrosis, is a condition where there is a loss of blood supply to a bone, leading to bone death.

While RA can be associated with interstitial lung disease, PF-ILD can be caused by various other factors such as environmental exposures, connective tissue diseases, and other autoimmune conditions. Therefore, having PF-ILD does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bacterial arthritis of sacroiliac joint,4328019,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly in the hands and feet, and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Bacterial arthritis of the sacroiliac joint, on the other hand, is an infection of the sacroiliac joint caused by bacteria, leading to symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and fever. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they affect different joints and have different underlying causes. Therefore, having bacterial arthritis of the sacroiliac joint does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral derangement of knee,42535058,True,"Yes, bilateral derangement of the knee can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric, meaning that both sides of the body are affected equally. Bilateral derangement of the knee suggests that both knees are affected, which is consistent with the symmetric polyarthritis seen in RA. Additionally, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction are common features of RA, which can lead to derangement of the knee joints. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral derangement of the knee, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finger wrinkling,4031008,False,"No, finger wrinkling is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Finger wrinkling is a common phenomenon that can occur due to various reasons such as aging, prolonged exposure to water, or certain medical conditions like thyroid disorders or dehydration. While finger wrinkling can be seen in some patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint inflammation and swelling, it is not a specific or definitive symptom of the disease. Therefore, having finger wrinkling does not necessarily mean that a person definitely has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of left elbow,37310488,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While infective arthritis of the left elbow is a specific condition affecting the left elbow joint due to an infection, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis is typically caused by a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection in the joint, leading to symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, redness, and limited range of motion. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the left elbow does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of right foot,37310481,False,"No, infective arthritis of the right foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis is caused by an infection in the joint, leading to inflammation and symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and redness. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can present with joint symptoms, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the right foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hypertrophy of fat pad of right knee,37310480,False,"No

Rationale: Hypertrophy of the fat pad of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While it may be seen in some cases of RA due to inflammation and joint swelling, it can also occur in other conditions such as osteoarthritis, trauma, or mechanical issues. Therefore, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of right hand,37310483,False,"No, infective arthritis of the right hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis is caused by an infection in the joint, leading to symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and redness. While some symptoms may overlap with RA, the underlying cause is different. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease, not an infection. Additionally, the specific location of the infection in the right hand does not necessarily indicate RA, as RA typically affects multiple joints symmetrically. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the right hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of left foot,37310482,False,"No

Rationale:
Infective arthritis of the left foot is a specific condition related to an infection in the joint of the left foot. While it may present with similar symptoms such as joint swelling and tenderness, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and infective arthritis is caused by an infection. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the left foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of right wrist,37310485,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints symmetrically, with a preference for small joints in the hands and feet. While infective arthritis can also cause joint swelling and tenderness, it is typically caused by an infection in the joint rather than an autoimmune response. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the right wrist does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of left hand,37310484,False,"No

Rationale: Infective arthritis of the left hand is a specific condition related to an infection in the joint of the left hand. While it may present with similar symptoms such as joint swelling and tenderness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Infective arthritis is caused by an infection, often bacterial, in the joint, and requires specific treatment such as antibiotics or drainage of the joint. It is important to differentiate between infective arthritis and autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis to provide appropriate treatment."
Infective arthritis of right elbow,37310487,True,"Yes, infective arthritis of the right elbow is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is an infection of the joint that can cause symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, similar to those seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, infective arthritis is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease. Therefore, if a patient has infective arthritis of the right elbow, they definitely do not have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of left wrist,37310486,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While infective arthritis of the left wrist may present with similar symptoms such as joint swelling and tenderness, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Bacterial arthritis is an infection of a joint that can cause symptoms similar to RA, such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. However, the presence of a bacterial infection in the joint is specific to bacterial arthritis and not RA. RA is an autoimmune disease, not an infection, so the presence of a bacterial infection in the patellofemoral joint would not be indicative of RA."
Hypertrophy of fat pad of left knee,37310479,False,"No

Rationale: Hypertrophy of the fat pad of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint swelling is a common symptom of RA, hypertrophy of the fat pad of the left knee can be caused by various other conditions such as trauma, osteoarthritis, or patellar tendinopathy. Therefore, having hypertrophy of the fat pad of the left knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bursitis of finger,4139522,False,"No, bursitis of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Bursitis is inflammation of the bursa, which is a small fluid-filled sac that cushions and lubricates areas where tendons, muscles, and bones rub together. While bursitis can occur in the fingers, it is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and presents with specific symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Bursitis of the finger may be a separate condition or may occur in conjunction with RA, but it is not specific to RA."
Bilateral osteoarthritis of feet due to trauma,42535128,False,"No

Rationale: The condition of bilateral osteoarthritis of the feet due to trauma is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that can be caused by trauma or wear and tear on the joints, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. While both conditions can affect the joints, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Therefore, having bilateral osteoarthritis of the feet due to trauma does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral gouty arthritis of feet,42535133,False,"No, bilateral gouty arthritis of feet is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and RA can present with joint pain and swelling, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Gout is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder. Additionally, RA primarily affects the synovial joints, while gout typically affects the big toe joint initially. Therefore, the presence of bilateral gouty arthritis of the feet does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral arthritis of subtalar joint,42535134,True,"Yes, bilateral arthritis of the subtalar joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric, and arthritis of the subtalar joint can be a manifestation of the disease.

Synovitis of left ankle joint,42539217,True,"Yes, synovitis of the left ankle joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis, which is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, is a common feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is typically symmetric and affects multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, if a patient presents with synovitis of the left ankle joint, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as a potential underlying cause."
Transient arthropathy of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger,4117090,False,"No

Rationale: While transient arthropathy of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to this malady. There are many other conditions that can cause transient arthropathy in this joint, such as trauma, infection, or other types of arthritis. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Charcot's joint of foot,4205084,False,"No

Rationale: Charcot's joint of the foot is a condition characterized by progressive degeneration of a weight-bearing joint, often seen in patients with diabetes mellitus. While it can lead to joint deformities and functional impairment similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Charcot's joint of the foot is typically associated with diabetes and neuropathy, rather than being an autoimmune disorder like RA. Therefore, having Charcot's joint of the foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Transient arthropathy of distal interphalangeal joint of finger,4117091,False,"No

Rationale: While transient arthropathy of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to this malady. There are many other conditions that can cause transient arthropathy in this joint, such as osteoarthritis or trauma. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Closed fracture of condyle of left femur,760430,False,"No, a closed fracture of the condyle of the left femur is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A closed fracture is a physical injury to the bone, typically caused by trauma or injury, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the joints. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may be at a higher risk for fractures due to joint damage and decreased bone density, a closed fracture of the condyle of the left femur is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of acromioclavicular joint,4323882,False,"No, arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet, arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint specifically refers to arthritis in the joint where the acromion (part of the scapula) meets the clavicle. This type of arthritis is more commonly associated with osteoarthritis or other degenerative joint conditions rather than RA. Therefore, having arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral gouty arthritis of ankles,42539261,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral gouty arthritis of ankles is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: Gouty arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gouty arthritis primarily affects the big toe, it can also involve other joints, including the ankles. However, the presence of bilateral gouty arthritis of the ankles is not a typical presentation of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is usually symmetric and affects the small joints of the hands and feet, with ankle involvement being less common. Therefore, the condition of bilateral gouty arthritis of ankles is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis,45768909,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, on the other hand, is a rare lung disorder characterized by the accumulation of surfactant proteins and lipids within the alveoli of the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange. These two conditions affect different organ systems and have distinct clinical presentations. Therefore, having autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Medial epicondyle apophysitis of left elbow due to overuse,42539248,False,"No

Rationale: Medial epicondyle apophysitis of the left elbow due to overuse is a condition commonly seen in young athletes, particularly baseball pitchers, gymnasts, and tennis players. It is characterized by pain and tenderness on the inner side of the elbow, where the tendons attach to the medial epicondyle of the humerus. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a localized overuse injury rather than a systemic autoimmune disease affecting multiple joints. While individuals with RA may experience joint pain in the elbow, the specific diagnosis of medial epicondyle apophysitis due to overuse is not indicative of RA."
Osteochondritis of the femoral head,4344383,False,"No, osteochondritis of the femoral head is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteochondritis of the femoral head is a condition characterized by a lack of blood supply to the femoral head, leading to bone death and potential collapse of the hip joint. While it can cause joint pain and stiffness, it is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, osteochondritis of the femoral head is typically seen in younger individuals, while Rheumatoid Arthritis is more common in older adults. Therefore, having osteochondritis of the femoral head does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Localized osteoarthritis of wrist,762486,False,"No

Rationale: Localized osteoarthritis of the wrist is a specific condition that affects the wrist joint due to wear and tear, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. While it is a form of arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joint, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints. Therefore, having localized osteoarthritis of the wrist does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of left elbow caused by Staphylococcus,37310649,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left elbow caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific cause mentioned in the condition (Staphylococcus infection) is not typically associated with RA. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas a Staphylococcus infection leading to arthritis would be considered septic arthritis, which is caused by a bacterial infection. Therefore, having arthritis of the left elbow caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left knee caused by Staphylococcus,37310648,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, ""Arthritis of left knee caused by Staphylococcus,"" specifically mentions an infection caused by Staphylococcus bacteria in the left knee joint. While this condition may lead to arthritis in the affected joint, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints and is not directly caused by a bacterial infection. Therefore, having arthritis in the left knee caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Osteoarthritis of left hip joint due to dysplasia,37310643,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the articular cartilage and subchondral bone, leading to joint pain, stiffness, and functional impairment. It is not an autoimmune disease like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, the underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria are different. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left hip joint due to dysplasia does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right knee caused by Staphylococcus,37310645,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right knee caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific cause mentioned in the condition (Staphylococcus infection) is not typically associated with RA. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease, not an infection caused by bacteria like Staphylococcus. Therefore, having arthritis in the right knee caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right elbow caused by Staphylococcus,37310646,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right elbow caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific cause mentioned in the condition (Staphylococcus infection) is not typically associated with RA. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas an infection with Staphylococcus would be considered septic arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis of the right elbow caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosis of right knee joint,37204143,True,"Yes, ankylosis of the right knee joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosis refers to the abnormal stiffening and immobility of a joint due to fusion of the bones, which can occur as a result of chronic inflammation and damage in conditions like RA. In RA, the chronic inflammation can lead to joint destruction and deformities, which can ultimately result in ankylosis. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosis of the right knee joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune urticaria and/or angioedema,4221673,False,"No

Rationale: Autoimmune urticaria and/or angioedema are conditions characterized by the immune system attacking the skin, leading to hives and swelling. While autoimmune conditions can sometimes coexist with Rheumatoid Arthritis, the presence of autoimmune urticaria and/or angioedema alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, the condition is not specific to the malady."
Gout of hip due to renal impairment,46270466,False,"No

Rationale: Gout of the hip due to renal impairment is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, often resulting in sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and RA are forms of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood, leading to the formation of urate crystals in the joints, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. Additionally, gout of the hip due to renal impairment suggests a specific etiology related to kidney dysfunction, which is not a characteristic feature of RA."
Aseptic necrosis of left lateral femoral condyle,42534985,True,"Yes, aseptic necrosis of the left lateral femoral condyle can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Aseptic necrosis, also known as avascular necrosis, is a condition where there is a loss of blood supply to a bone, leading to bone death. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic inflammation and destruction of joints can lead to aseptic necrosis in certain bones, including the femoral condyles. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops aseptic necrosis in the left lateral femoral condyle, it is likely related to their underlying condition."
Neutropenia associated with autoimmune disease,4008700,True,"Yes, neutropenia associated with autoimmune disease can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Neutropenia, which is a low level of neutrophils in the blood, can be a common finding in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the autoimmune nature of the disease. In RA, the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, including the bone marrow where neutrophils are produced. Therefore, if a patient with RA presents with neutropenia, it is highly likely that it is specifically related to their Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Aseptic necrosis of right lateral femoral condyle,42534984,False,"No, aseptic necrosis of the right lateral femoral condyle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Aseptic necrosis, also known as avascular necrosis, is a condition where there is a loss of blood supply to a bone, leading to bone death. It can be caused by various factors such as trauma, corticosteroid use, alcohol abuse, and certain medical conditions. While aseptic necrosis can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having aseptic necrosis of the right lateral femoral condyle does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Fingertip eczema,4270726,False,"No

Rationale: Fingertip eczema is a skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin on the fingertips. While it can be a symptom of various conditions, including autoimmune diseases like RA, it is not specific to RA. Fingertip eczema can also be caused by other factors such as contact dermatitis, fungal infections, or irritants. Therefore, having fingertip eczema does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Osteoarthritis of right foot,36712696,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is different from rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right foot does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of vertebra,46270474,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, primary chronic gout without tophus of vertebra, is specific to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to episodes of severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes and clinical presentations. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of vertebra does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Mechanical failure of right knee prosthetic joint,42534976,False,"No

Rationale: The condition of mechanical failure of a right knee prosthetic joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While patients with RA may require joint replacements due to joint damage caused by the disease, mechanical failure of a prosthetic joint can occur for various reasons unrelated to RA, such as infection, wear and tear, or implant loosening. Therefore, having a mechanical failure of a right knee prosthetic joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of left foot,36712697,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left foot does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of wrist,46270475,False,"No

Rationale: Primary chronic gout without tophus of wrist is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe attacks of pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint conditions, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of wrist does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Dactylitis of finger,46270490,True,"Yes, dactylitis of the finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Dactylitis, also known as ""sausage digit,"" is a condition characterized by inflammation and swelling of an entire digit, such as a finger or toe. In the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, dactylitis can be a specific manifestation of the disease, particularly in the early stages. It is often seen in RA patients as a result of synovitis and tenosynovitis affecting the entire digit, leading to the characteristic sausage-like appearance. Therefore, if a patient presents with dactylitis of the finger, it may strongly suggest the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cyst of meniscus of right knee,37310681,False,"No

Rationale: A cyst of the meniscus of the right knee is a specific condition related to the knee joint, which is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling in various joints, including the knee, the presence of a cyst of the meniscus in the right knee does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis for an accurate diagnosis."
Cyst of meniscus of left knee,37310682,False,"No, a cyst of the meniscus of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A cyst of the meniscus is a separate condition that involves a fluid-filled sac within the knee joint, typically caused by a tear in the meniscus. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect the joints, including the knees, the presence of a meniscal cyst does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other factors such as joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings to diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reattached finger(s) complication,80617,False,"No, the condition of reattached finger(s) complication is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reattaching fingers is a surgical procedure to restore function and appearance after traumatic amputation. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect the joints in the fingers, the presence of reattached finger(s) complication does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other factors and diagnostic criteria specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis when assessing for this malady."
Arthritis of left knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,37310673,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is not specifically caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. RA is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, while arthritis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is a specific type of infectious arthritis resulting from a bacterial infection. While infectious arthritis can present with similar symptoms such as joint pain and swelling, the underlying cause and treatment approach are different. Therefore, having arthritis of the left knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,37310672,False,"No, arthritis of the right knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while arthritis of the right knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is a specific type of arthritis caused by a bacterial infection. The presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae as the cause of arthritis in the right knee indicates an infectious etiology, rather than an autoimmune one like in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis of the right knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss,4176595,False,"No

Rationale: Autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While autoimmune conditions can sometimes be associated with RA, the presence of autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. It is important to consider other factors and conduct further evaluations to determine the underlying cause of the hearing loss."
Xerostomia due to autoimmune disease,45768790,True,"Yes, xerostomia due to autoimmune disease can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Xerostomia, or dry mouth, can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the autoimmune nature of the disease. In RA, the immune system attacks the body's own tissues, including the salivary glands, leading to decreased saliva production and resulting in xerostomia. Therefore, if a patient presents with xerostomia due to an autoimmune disease, it is possible that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of bilateral elbows,760570,False,"No, osteoarthritis of bilateral elbows is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disease like RA. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, osteoarthritis typically affects weight-bearing joints and is more common in older individuals. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of bilateral elbows does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left knee caused by Streptococcus,37208262,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left knee caused by Streptococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while the condition described suggests an infection of the left knee caused by Streptococcus bacteria. Although arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific cause of Streptococcus infection in the left knee does not align with the characteristic features of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right knee caused by Streptococcus,37208261,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right knee caused by Streptococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while the condition described is caused by a bacterial infection (Streptococcus). The presence of Streptococcus as the cause of arthritis in the right knee indicates a different etiology than Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right elbow caused by bacteria,42539396,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right elbow caused by bacteria"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while arthritis caused by bacteria in the right elbow suggests an infectious etiology rather than an autoimmune one. In this case, the condition is more likely related to a bacterial infection rather than Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Psoriatic arthritis with spine involvement,4064048,True,"Yes, psoriatic arthritis with spine involvement is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that occurs in some patients with psoriasis. It can affect the spine, causing inflammation in the joints between the vertebrae, known as spondylitis. However, spine involvement is more commonly associated with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a different condition than Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, the presence of psoriatic arthritis with spine involvement does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune myopathy,36716807,True,"Yes, autoimmune myopathy can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: Autoimmune myopathy is a condition characterized by muscle weakness and inflammation due to an autoimmune response targeting muscle tissue. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is possible for autoimmune myopathy to occur as a manifestation of the autoimmune process affecting the joints. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis also has autoimmune myopathy, it is likely that the myopathy is specifically related to the RA."
Neoplasm of blood vessel of finger,4131588,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While it can lead to deformities and functional impairment in the joints, it does not specifically involve neoplasms of blood vessels in the fingers. Neoplasms of blood vessels in the fingers are more commonly associated with conditions such as hemangiomas or angiosarcomas, which are not typically linked to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having a neoplasm of a blood vessel in the finger does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Complete tear, ankle and/or foot ligament",4019070,False,"No, a complete tear of an ankle and/or foot ligament is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint pain and swelling can be symptoms of RA, a complete tear of a ligament is a specific injury rather than a symptom of an autoimmune disorder like RA. In this case, the condition of a complete tear of an ankle and/or foot ligament does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Eczema of finger,4297483,False,"No, eczema of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Eczema is a skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin. While some patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have eczema, eczema of the finger is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The presence of eczema of the finger does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Adult osteochondritis of spine,4289292,False,"No, adult osteochondritis of the spine is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteochondritis is a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the bone and cartilage in the joints, which can occur in various parts of the body including the spine. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, osteochondritis of the spine is a separate condition that involves the bones and cartilage of the spine specifically. Therefore, having adult osteochondritis of the spine does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Mechanical failure of left knee prosthetic joint,36712802,False,"No, the condition ""Mechanical failure of left knee prosthetic joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Mechanical failure of a prosthetic joint typically indicates a problem with the prosthetic itself, such as wear and tear, loosening, or fracture, rather than being directly related to an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA. While RA can lead to joint damage and deformities, mechanical failure of a prosthetic joint is a separate issue that can occur for various reasons unrelated to RA."
Rheumatoid nodulosis,4270869,True,"Yes, rheumatoid nodulosis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid nodulosis refers to the presence of subcutaneous nodules in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. These nodules are typically found over pressure points or areas of trauma, such as the elbows or fingers. While not all patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis will develop rheumatoid nodulosis, the presence of these nodules is highly indicative of the disease. Therefore, if a patient has rheumatoid nodulosis, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tenosynovitis of fingers,4344603,True,"Yes, tenosynovitis of fingers can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tenosynovitis is inflammation of the tendon sheath, which can commonly occur in patients with RA due to the inflammatory nature of the disease affecting the synovial joints. In RA, tenosynovitis can present as a symptom of the disease, particularly in the fingers where joint involvement is common. Therefore, if a patient has tenosynovitis of the fingers, it may suggest the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gonococcal spondylitis,72562,False,"No, Gonococcal spondylitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gonococcal spondylitis is a rare infection of the spine caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is the same bacteria that causes gonorrhea. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gonococcal spondylitis typically presents with back pain, fever, and neurological symptoms due to spinal cord compression. Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, blood tests, imaging studies, and sometimes joint fluid analysis. Treatment involves antibiotics to eradicate the infection."
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,42535177,True,"Yes, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that involves inflammation in five or more joints. This condition is similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis in terms of joint involvement, symmetrical polyarthritis, and potential joint damage and deformities. Therefore, if a person has polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, they definitely have a form of arthritis that is similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, not all cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis present in childhood or adolescence, so not all individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis will have had polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis as a child."
Hydroxyapatite deposition disease of right shoulder,35615134,False,"No

Rationale: Hydroxyapatite deposition disease of the right shoulder is a condition characterized by the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in the soft tissues around the shoulder joint, leading to inflammation and pain. While this condition may cause symptoms similar to arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a distinct autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, with specific diagnostic criteria involving joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings. Therefore, having hydroxyapatite deposition disease of the right shoulder does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema,40483306,True,"Yes, the condition ""remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This condition is actually a subset of RA, known as RS3PE syndrome, which is characterized by symmetrical synovitis (inflammation of the synovial joints), pitting edema (swelling that leaves an indentation when pressed), and a lack of rheumatoid factor in the blood (seronegative). Therefore, if a patient has this specific condition, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral gouty arthritis of knees,42539266,False,"No.

Rationale:
The condition described, bilateral gouty arthritis of knees, is specific to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. In contrast, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints with characteristic features such as symmetric polyarthritis, joint swelling, and deformities. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having bilateral gouty arthritis of knees does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of left midtarsal joint,42539289,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of left midtarsal joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In Rheumatoid Arthritis, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect small joints, such as those in the hands and feet. The presence of arthritis in the midtarsal joint of the left foot aligns with the pattern of joint involvement seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, the description of Rheumatoid Arthritis mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are consistent with arthritis in the midtarsal joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the left midtarsal joint, they are likely to have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Recurrent rheumatic heart disease,4062117,False,"No, recurrent rheumatic heart disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatic heart disease is a complication of rheumatic fever, which is caused by an untreated streptococcal infection. It primarily affects the heart valves, leading to damage and dysfunction. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions involve inflammation, they affect different systems in the body and have distinct etiologies. Therefore, having recurrent rheumatic heart disease does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral chronic rupture of anterior cruciate ligament of knees,35615110,False,"No

Rationale: The condition of bilateral chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knees is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may experience joint pain and swelling, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet, the specific condition of bilateral chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knees is not a defining characteristic of RA. This condition is more commonly associated with trauma or repetitive stress on the knees rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA."
Bilateral osteoarthritis of midtarsal joints of feet,35615108,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral osteoarthritis of midtarsal joints of feet is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. Osteoarthritis, on the other hand, is a degenerative joint disease that typically affects weight-bearing joints such as the knees, hips, and spine. The presence of bilateral osteoarthritis of midtarsal joints of feet is not a common feature of osteoarthritis but is more characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral osteoarthritis of midtarsal joints of feet, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right hand caused by bacteria,42539287,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis of the right hand caused by bacteria suggests an infectious etiology. While RA can lead to joint damage and deformities, it is not specifically caused by bacteria. Therefore, having arthritis of the right hand caused by bacteria does not necessarily mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of the hand associated with helminthiasis,80801,False,"No, arthropathy of the hand associated with helminthiasis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Arthropathy refers to any disease or abnormal condition affecting the joints, and helminthiasis is an infection caused by parasitic worms. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints with specific clinical criteria and serological markers, arthropathy associated with helminthiasis is a result of a parasitic infection and may present differently. Therefore, having arthropathy of the hand associated with helminthiasis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Climacteric arthritis of multiple sites,80806,True,"Yes, climacteric arthritis of multiple sites is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Climacteric arthritis refers to arthritis that occurs during the climacteric period, which is the transitional phase leading to menopause in women. The term ""climacteric arthritis of multiple sites"" suggests arthritis affecting multiple joints during this period. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, affecting multiple joints. Therefore, if a person has climacteric arthritis of multiple sites, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis, as the symptoms and presentation align with the criteria for diagnosing RA."
Chronic rupture of lateral collateral ligament of left knee,35609016,False,"No, chronic rupture of the lateral collateral ligament of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition of chronic rupture of the lateral collateral ligament of the left knee is a specific injury to the knee ligament and is not a characteristic symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling, a chronic rupture of a ligament in the knee is a separate issue that is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder."
Chronic rupture of lateral collateral ligament of right knee,35609015,False,"No

Rationale:
A chronic rupture of the lateral collateral ligament of the right knee is a specific condition related to a knee injury, and it is not directly associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint damage and deformities, it is not specifically linked to a chronic rupture of a ligament in the knee. RA is characterized by autoimmune inflammation and joint symptoms, whereas a ligament rupture is a mechanical injury. Therefore, having a chronic rupture of the lateral collateral ligament of the right knee does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pyogenic arthritis of ankle,4068237,False,"No

Rationale: Pyogenic arthritis of the ankle is a specific condition involving a bacterial infection of the ankle joint, which is different from the autoimmune inflammatory disorder of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions may present with joint swelling and tenderness, the underlying causes and mechanisms are distinct. Therefore, having pyogenic arthritis of the ankle does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteochondritis of the talus,4301698,False,"No, osteochondritis of the talus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteochondritis of the talus is a condition characterized by the death of a segment of bone in the talus bone of the ankle joint. It is typically caused by a lack of blood flow to the affected area. While it can cause joint pain and stiffness, it is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, osteochondritis of the talus is a localized condition affecting a specific bone in the ankle, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting multiple joints throughout the body."
Chronic crepitant synovitis of wrist,4287383,True,"Yes, chronic crepitant synovitis of the wrist is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by chronic inflammation of the synovial joints, leading to symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Chronic crepitant synovitis of the wrist, which is the presence of a grinding or popping sensation in the wrist joint due to inflammation, aligns with the inflammatory nature of RA. Additionally, the involvement of the wrist joint is common in RA, as it often affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, if a patient presents with chronic crepitant synovitis of the wrist, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune ganglionopathy,3654638,False,"No

Rationale:
Autoimmune ganglionopathy is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system, specifically the ganglia. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it does not primarily affect the synovial joints as seen in RA. While autoimmune conditions can sometimes coexist, having autoimmune ganglionopathy does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune optic neuropathy,3654632,False,"No

Rationale: Autoimmune optic neuropathy is a condition affecting the optic nerve, leading to vision loss or impairment. While autoimmune conditions can coexist with rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune optic neuropathy is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. It is possible to have autoimmune optic neuropathy without having rheumatoid arthritis, so the presence of autoimmune optic neuropathy does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle and/or foot,74720,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle and/or foot"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Behcet's syndrome is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions, and uveitis. Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome refers to joint involvement, which can affect the ankle and foot. However, this specific arthropathy is not a typical feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is primarily seen in the small joints of the hands and feet, with symmetric polyarthritis being a hallmark feature. Therefore, the presence of arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rupture of anterior cruciate ligament of left knee,760825,False,"No

Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement can be a symptom of RA, a specific injury like a ligament rupture is not a defining characteristic of the disease. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, rather than acute injuries like ligament ruptures. Therefore, having a ligament rupture does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rupture of anterior cruciate ligament of right knee,760824,False,"No

Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may experience joint pain and swelling, a rupture of the ACL is a specific injury to the knee ligament and is not a characteristic symptom of RA. Additionally, the causes of ACL rupture are typically related to trauma or sports injuries, rather than being directly linked to an autoimmune condition like RA."
Pyogenic bacterial arthritis of hip,764920,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the hip is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic bacterial arthritis is a type of infectious arthritis caused by bacteria entering the joint space, leading to inflammation and joint damage. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic inflammation and joint destruction can increase the risk of developing secondary infections such as pyogenic bacterial arthritis. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the hip, it is highly likely that the underlying malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis is present."
Cutaneous atrophy due to rheumatoid arthritis,4297650,False,"No

Rationale: Cutaneous atrophy is a condition characterized by thinning of the skin, which can be caused by various factors such as aging, prolonged use of corticosteroids, or certain skin conditions. While rheumatoid arthritis can lead to various skin manifestations such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, or skin ulcers, cutaneous atrophy is not a specific symptom or manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having cutaneous atrophy does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Acute tear of meniscus of left knee,760823,False,"No

Rationale: An acute tear of the meniscus of the left knee is a specific condition related to an injury to the knee joint, typically caused by trauma or degeneration. While it can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and limited range of motion in the knee, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder, whereas a meniscus tear is a mechanical injury to the knee joint. Therefore, having an acute tear of the meniscus of the left knee does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Pyogenic bacterial arthritis of elbow,764919,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the elbow is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic bacterial arthritis is an infection of the joint caused by bacteria, leading to joint inflammation, pain, and swelling. While both conditions can present with joint swelling and tenderness, the presence of a bacterial infection in the joint is specific to pyogenic bacterial arthritis and not a characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the elbow, they do not necessarily have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Villous arthropathy of multiple joints,764931,True,"Yes, the condition of villous arthropathy of multiple joints is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Villous arthropathy refers to the presence of villous hypertrophy in the synovium of joints, which is a characteristic finding in Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition is a hallmark of RA and is not typically seen in other types of arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has villous arthropathy of multiple joints, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Spondylosis due to another disorder,764930,False,"No

Rationale: Spondylosis due to another disorder is a degenerative condition affecting the spine, characterized by the degeneration of the intervertebral discs and the formation of bone spurs. While spondylosis can cause joint pain and stiffness, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having spondylosis due to another disorder does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chest deformity due to ankylosing spondylitis,3654715,False,"No. The condition of chest deformity due to ankylosing spondylitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to fusion and stiffness of the spine. While ankylosing spondylitis can cause chest deformities due to the fusion of the ribs to the spine, this is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having a chest deformity due to ankylosing spondylitis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Overriding fingers,4209752,False,"No, the condition of overriding fingers is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Overriding fingers can be caused by various factors such as trauma, congenital abnormalities, or other inflammatory conditions affecting the joints. While it can be seen in some cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint deformities and damage, it is not a definitive indicator of the disease. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in a patient presenting with overriding fingers."
Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the spine,4176931,True,"Yes, arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the spine is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Behcet's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis that can affect multiple organ systems, including the musculoskeletal system. Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the spine refers to inflammation and damage to the joints of the spine, which can lead to symptoms such as back pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. 

While arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the spine is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is a condition that can be present in patients with RA. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the spine, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, having Rheumatoid Arthritis does not necessarily mean that a patient will have arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the spine, as it is a specific manifestation of Behcet's syndrome."
Malignant neoplasm of connective and soft tissue of finger,4095010,False,"No, the condition ""Malignant neoplasm of connective and soft tissue of finger"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop joint deformities and damage, a malignant neoplasm (cancer) of the connective and soft tissue of the finger is a separate and distinct condition. This condition would require a separate diagnosis and treatment plan from Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosing spondylitis with organ / system involvement,4035614,True,"Yes, ankylosing spondylitis with organ/system involvement is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, but it can also involve other organs/systems such as the eyes, heart, and lungs. While both ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis are autoimmune inflammatory disorders, they have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosing spondylitis with organ/system involvement, they do not necessarily have rheumatoid arthritis."
Polymyositis associated with autoimmune disease,4346977,True,"Yes, the condition of polymyositis associated with autoimmune disease is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Polymyositis is an autoimmune inflammatory myopathy that can be associated with various autoimmune diseases, including Rheumatoid Arthritis. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, polymyositis can present as muscle weakness and inflammation, which can be confirmed through muscle biopsy and electromyography. Therefore, if a patient has polymyositis associated with autoimmune disease, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finger ulcer,4205676,True,"Yes, a finger ulcer can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In patients with RA, chronic inflammation can lead to the formation of ulcers on the fingers, known as rheumatoid ulcers. These ulcers are typically located over bony prominences and can be painful and slow to heal. Therefore, if a patient presents with a finger ulcer, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a common manifestation of the disease."
Lateral epicondylitis of right humerus,37109275,False,"No, lateral epicondylitis of the right humerus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, is a condition characterized by pain and inflammation on the outer part of the elbow. It is typically caused by overuse of the forearm muscles and tendons. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop lateral epicondylitis as a secondary condition due to joint inflammation and stress on the tendons, having lateral epicondylitis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hemarthrosis of right knee,37109261,True,"Yes, hemarthrosis of the right knee can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hemarthrosis, which is bleeding into a joint, can occur in patients with RA due to inflammation and damage to the synovial lining of the joint. In RA, the chronic inflammation can lead to joint swelling, pain, and ultimately joint destruction, which can result in bleeding into the joint space. Therefore, if a patient with RA presents with hemarthrosis of the right knee, it is likely related to their underlying condition."
Enterobacterial spondylitis,4068478,False,"No, Enterobacterial spondylitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Enterobacterial spondylitis is a bacterial infection of the spine, typically caused by Enterobacteriaceae bacteria such as E. coli or Klebsiella. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and inflammation, they have different underlying causes and require different treatment approaches."
Subungual hematoma of little finger of right hand,37310077,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma of the little finger of the right hand is a localized collection of blood underneath the nail. While this condition can occur in individuals with various underlying health conditions, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Subungual hematomas can result from trauma or injury to the nail bed, and they are not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having a subungual hematoma of the little finger of the right hand does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Subungual hematoma of little finger of left hand,37310076,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma of the little finger of the left hand is a localized collection of blood underneath the nail. While this condition can occur in individuals with various underlying health conditions, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Subungual hematomas can result from trauma or injury to the nail bed, such as crushing or slamming the finger in a door. Therefore, the presence of a subungual hematoma in this specific location does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Subungual hematoma of ring finger of right hand,37310079,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma of the ring finger of the right hand is a localized collection of blood under the nail, typically caused by trauma to the finger. While this condition may cause pain and discoloration of the nail, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and deformities. Therefore, having a subungual hematoma does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."

Rationale: Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gouty arthritis can affect the toe joints, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gouty arthritis is caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the toe does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Subungual hematoma of ring finger of left hand,37310078,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma of the ring finger of the left hand is a localized collection of blood underneath the nail, typically caused by trauma to the finger. While this condition is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis, it is possible for a person with RA to develop a subungual hematoma due to joint deformities or damage in the hands. However, the presence of a subungual hematoma alone does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Calcinosis in fingers,4093043,True,"Yes, calcinosis in fingers can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Calcinosis is a condition characterized by the deposition of calcium salts in the soft tissues of the body, including the fingers. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, calcinosis can occur as a result of chronic inflammation and joint damage. Therefore, if a patient presents with calcinosis in the fingers, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of calcinosis, such as systemic sclerosis or other connective tissue disorders, before making a definitive diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Closed fracture of condyle of right femur,765014,False,"No, a closed fracture of the condyle of the right femur is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A closed fracture is a physical injury to the bone, typically caused by trauma or injury, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may be at a higher risk for fractures due to joint damage and osteoporosis, the presence of a closed fracture of the condyle of the right femur does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of temporomandibular joint as part of polyarthritis,4033630,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of temporomandibular joint as part of polyarthritis"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. The involvement of the temporomandibular joint as part of polyarthritis would be consistent with the systemic nature of RA. Additionally, the presence of arthritis in the temporomandibular joint as part of polyarthritis would align with the clinical criteria for diagnosing RA, which includes joint involvement. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis of the temporomandibular joint as part of polyarthritis, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pyogenic bacterial arthritis of hand,765024,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the hand is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic bacterial arthritis is an infection of the joint caused by bacteria, which can lead to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, similar to the symptoms of RA. In patients with RA, the immune system is already compromised, making them more susceptible to infections such as pyogenic bacterial arthritis. Therefore, if a patient with RA develops pyogenic bacterial arthritis in the hand, it is highly likely that they have RA."
Reactive arthritis of spine,765044,True,"Yes, reactive arthritis of the spine is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that can affect the spine, joints, eyes, skin, and urinary tract. It is often triggered by an infection in another part of the body. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it primarily affects the synovial joints but can also involve the spine, leading to symptoms such as back pain, stiffness, and inflammation. Therefore, if a person has reactive arthritis of the spine, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital genu varum of bilateral knees,765067,False,"No

Rationale: Congenital genu varum of bilateral knees refers to a condition where a person has bow legs from birth. While this condition may affect the musculoskeletal system, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and destruction. Therefore, having congenital genu varum of bilateral knees does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."

Rationale: Ankylosing spondylitis with multisystem involvement is a separate condition from Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to stiffness, pain, and eventual fusion of the spine. While both conditions are autoimmune inflammatory disorders, they have distinct clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having ankylosing spondylitis with multisystem involvement does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of knee due to viral infection,4181150,False,"No, arthritis of the knee due to a viral infection is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis of the knee due to a viral infection is caused by a viral infection and is not autoimmune in nature. While both conditions may present with joint pain and swelling, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Therefore, having arthritis of the knee due to a viral infection does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Capsulitis of ankle,760994,False,"No

Rationale: Capsulitis of the ankle is a condition characterized by inflammation of the ligaments surrounding the ankle joint. While joint inflammation is a common feature of both capsulitis of the ankle and rheumatoid arthritis, the specific presentation, diagnostic criteria, and underlying pathophysiology of these conditions are different. Therefore, having capsulitis of the ankle does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Capsulitis of tarsus,760993,False,"No, capsulitis of tarsus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Capsulitis of tarsus refers to inflammation of the joint capsule in the midfoot region, specifically the tarsometatarsal joints. While joint inflammation is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, capsulitis of tarsus is not a defining characteristic of RA. Additionally, capsulitis of tarsus can be caused by other factors such as overuse, trauma, or biomechanical issues, making it a non-specific condition for Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovial osteochondromatosis of distal interphalangeal joint of finger,4068493,False,"No

Rationale: Synovial osteochondromatosis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger is a benign condition characterized by the formation of multiple cartilaginous nodules within the synovial lining of joints. While this condition may cause joint swelling and stiffness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having synovial osteochondromatosis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger does not definitively mean that an individual has rheumatoid arthritis."
Subungual hematoma of middle finger of right hand,37310081,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma of the middle finger of the right hand is a localized collection of blood under the nail, typically caused by trauma to the finger. While this condition may cause pain and discoloration of the nail, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis.

Subungual hematomas are not a characteristic symptom or sign of RA. Therefore, having a subungual hematoma of the index finger of the left hand does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Antisynthetase syndrome,40482477,True,"Yes, Antisynthetase syndrome is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Antisynthetase syndrome is a rare autoimmune condition characterized by the presence of antisynthetase antibodies, myositis (inflammation of the muscles), interstitial lung disease, arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon, and mechanic's hands. One of the key features of Antisynthetase syndrome is arthritis, which can mimic the joint involvement seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, patients with Antisynthetase syndrome may also have other symptoms that overlap with those seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis, such as joint pain and morning stiffness. Therefore, if a patient has Antisynthetase syndrome, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis, making it specific to this malady."
Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the hand,81100,True,"Yes, arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Behcet's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis that can affect multiple organ systems, including the joints. Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome can present similarly to RA with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. However, the key difference is that Behcet's syndrome is not primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints like RA. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the hand, they may have symptoms similar to RA, but they do not have RA itself."
Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of right wrist,37207782,False,"No, familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of the right wrist is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition is a condition characterized by the accumulation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. While joint involvement is a common feature in both conditions, the underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria for each are different. Therefore, having familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of the right wrist does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of right knee,37207781,False,"No.

Rationale: Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition (FCPD) is a genetic condition that causes the accumulation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, leading to symptoms similar to arthritis. However, FCPD is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While FCPD can cause joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, it is a distinct condition from RA. Therefore, having FCPD does not necessarily mean that a person has RA."
Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of left wrist,37207780,False,"No.

Rationale: Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition is a condition related to the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, leading to symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. While these symptoms may overlap with those of rheumatoid arthritis, familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of the left wrist does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of left knee,37207779,False,"No, familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition is a condition characterized by the accumulation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. While it can cause symptoms similar to arthritis, it is not directly related to RA. RA is specifically characterized by autoimmune inflammation affecting the synovial joints, which is different from the crystal deposition seen in familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition."
Acquired deformity of left finger,765150,False,"No

Rationale: An acquired deformity of a left finger is a specific condition that can have various causes, such as trauma, infection, or other inflammatory conditions. While rheumatoid arthritis can lead to joint deformities in the hands and fingers, not all acquired deformities of the fingers are specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having an acquired deformity of a left finger does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Fistula of right knee joint,37207790,False,"No, a fistula of the right knee joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A fistula is an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as an organ or blood vessel. In the context of the knee joint, a fistula could be caused by various conditions such as infection, trauma, or inflammatory arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint destruction, the presence of a fistula in the knee joint does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing would be needed to determine the underlying cause of the fistula."
Fistula of left knee joint,37207786,False,"No, a fistula of the left knee joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A fistula is an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as an organ or blood vessel. In the case of the left knee joint, a fistula could be caused by various factors such as infection, trauma, or other underlying conditions. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint damage and deformities, a fistula in the knee joint is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having a fistula of the left knee joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, extended oligoarthritis",4261027,True,"Yes, the condition of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, extended oligoarthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a group of chronic inflammatory diseases affecting children under the age of 16, with extended oligoarthritis being a subtype characterized by involvement of more than four joints within the first six months of disease onset. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is also a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, with symmetric polyarthritis and joint swelling being key features. 

Given that extended oligoarthritis is a subtype of JIA that involves multiple joints, it aligns with the joint involvement seen in RA. Therefore, if a patient has the condition of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, extended oligoarthritis, they would definitely have the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of ligament of right foot joint,37207773,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of ligament of right foot joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of RA, the specific description of a disorder of the ligament of the right foot joint does not definitively point to RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, and symptoms typically involve multiple joints, not just a single ligament in one foot. Additionally, the description does not mention other key features of RA such as morning stiffness, joint swelling, and systemic autoimmune involvement. Therefore, the presence of a disorder of the ligament of the right foot joint does not necessarily indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hemarthrosis of distal interphalangeal joint of finger,4117717,False,"No

Rationale:
Hemarthrosis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger is a condition characterized by bleeding into the joint space of the finger. While this condition can occur in various situations such as trauma or bleeding disorders, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hemarthrosis is not a defining feature of RA, and it can occur in other conditions as well. Therefore, having hemarthrosis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of ligament of left foot joint,37207772,False,"No. A disorder of the ligament of the left foot joint is a specific condition related to the ligaments in the foot joint and does not specifically indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can affect joints in the feet, the presence of a disorder of the ligament in the left foot joint alone does not definitively point to RA. Further evaluation and diagnostic criteria specific to RA would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Foot joint inflamed,4179145,True,"Yes, the condition ""foot joint inflamed"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint inflammation is a hallmark feature, and it commonly affects the small joints of the hands and feet. The presence of joint inflammation in the foot is consistent with the pattern of joint involvement seen in RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are all characteristics of inflamed joints in this condition. Therefore, if a person has an inflamed foot joint, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia,4172999,True,"Yes, autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia is a condition where the mother's antibodies attack the baby's platelets, leading to a low platelet count in the newborn. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, and autoimmune conditions can sometimes be passed from mother to baby. Therefore, if a newborn has autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia, it is likely that the mother has an autoimmune condition such as Rheumatoid Arthritis. So, if someone has autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia, they definitely have a connection to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finger joint effusion,4179142,True,"Yes, finger joint effusion can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint swelling is a common symptom, and effusion in the finger joints can be indicative of the inflammatory process that occurs in this condition. Additionally, the presence of joint effusion in the fingers, along with other clinical criteria and serological markers, can contribute to the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovial osteochondromatosis of metacarpophalangeal joint,4066501,False,"No

Rationale: Synovial osteochondromatosis of the metacarpophalangeal joint is a benign condition characterized by the formation of multiple cartilaginous nodules within the synovial lining of the joint. While this condition may cause joint swelling and discomfort, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having synovial osteochondromatosis of the metacarpophalangeal joint does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Ankylosis of left knee joint,37207752,True,"Yes, ankylosis of the left knee joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosis refers to the abnormal stiffening and immobility of a joint due to fusion of the bones, which can occur as a result of chronic inflammation and damage in conditions like RA. In RA, the chronic inflammation can lead to joint destruction and deformities, including ankylosis. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosis of the left knee joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of shoulder due to renal impairment,46270412,False,"No

Rationale: Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It typically affects the big toe but can also involve other joints such as the shoulder. Gout is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they are two distinct conditions with different underlying causes. In this case, the presence of gout in the shoulder due to renal impairment suggests a different etiology than Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints."
Gout of wrist due to renal impairment,46270413,False,"No

Rationale: Gout of the wrist due to renal impairment is a specific condition that is not necessarily indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and RA are forms of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Gout is typically associated with high levels of uric acid in the blood, while RA is an autoimmune disease affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having gout of the wrist due to renal impairment does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic tophaceous gout of ankle due to renal impairment,46270416,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic tophaceous gout of the ankle due to renal impairment is a specific condition associated with gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. In the case of chronic tophaceous gout, the presence of tophi (uric acid crystal deposits) in the joints due to renal impairment is a hallmark feature of gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having chronic tophaceous gout of the ankle due to renal impairment does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic gout of ankle without tophus due to renal impairment,46270417,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic gout of the ankle without tophus due to renal impairment is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having chronic gout of the ankle without tophus due to renal impairment does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot associated with helminthiasis,72985,False,"No

Rationale: Arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot associated with helminthiasis is a condition specifically related to a parasitic infection (helminthiasis) that can cause joint inflammation and pain in the ankle and foot. While this condition may present with joint symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Therefore, having arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot associated with helminthiasis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Kashin-Beck disease of the ankle and/or foot,75037,False,"No.

Rationale:
Kashin-Beck disease is a chronic, endemic osteochondropathy that primarily affects the growth plates of the long bones, leading to stunted growth and joint deformities. It is not specifically associated with the ankle and/or foot joints, as it typically affects the knees, elbows, and wrists. Additionally, Kashin-Beck disease is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having Kashin-Beck disease of the ankle and/or foot does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Arthropathy associated with mycoses, of the ankle and/or foot",72989,False,"No.

Rationale: Arthropathy associated with mycoses, of the ankle and/or foot is a condition specifically related to fungal infections causing joint inflammation in the ankle and/or foot. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is caused by a different etiology (fungal infection) and does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, the presence of arthropathy associated with mycoses in the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that the individual has RA."
Arthritis of right ankle caused by bacteria,42534825,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition described, ""Arthritis of right ankle caused by bacteria,"" is specific to an infection-related arthritis, which is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and it is not typically caused by a bacterial infection. While infections can sometimes trigger reactive arthritis, this is different from the chronic autoimmune nature of RA. Therefore, having arthritis of the right ankle caused by bacteria does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right ankle caused by Staphylococcus,37207831,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, ""Arthritis of right ankle caused by Staphylococcus,"" is a specific type of arthritis caused by a bacterial infection, specifically Staphylococcus. This is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While RA can affect various joints in the body, it is not typically caused by a bacterial infection like Staphylococcus. Therefore, having arthritis of the right ankle caused by Staphylococcus does not necessarily mean that a person has RA."
Arthritis of left wrist caused by Staphylococcus,37207830,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left wrist caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific cause mentioned in the condition (Staphylococcus infection) is not typically associated with RA. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas a Staphylococcus infection leading to arthritis would be considered septic arthritis, which is caused by a bacterial infection. Therefore, having arthritis of the left wrist caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left hand caused by bacteria,42534824,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, not caused by bacteria. While bacterial infections can cause arthritis, this specific condition of ""Arthritis of left hand caused by bacteria"" does not necessarily indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. The presence of bacteria as the cause of the arthritis suggests a different etiology than the autoimmune nature of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left hip caused by Staphylococcus,37207829,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left hip caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described is specifically caused by a bacterial infection (Staphylococcus) in the left hip joint, which is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While bacterial infections can sometimes lead to arthritis, this specific condition is not indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral congenital knee dislocation,3654933,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Bilateral congenital knee dislocation, on the other hand, is a rare condition present at birth where both knees are dislocated. These two conditions are not directly related, and having bilateral congenital knee dislocation does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left ankle caused by Staphylococcus,37207828,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left ankle caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific cause mentioned in the condition (Staphylococcus infection) is not typically associated with RA. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas an infection with Staphylococcus would be considered septic arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis in the left ankle caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis of the left ankle caused by bacteria suggests an infectious etiology. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having arthritis of the left ankle caused by bacteria does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Open fracture of intercondylar spine of left tibia,37310234,False,"No, an open fracture of the intercondylar spine of the left tibia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. An open fracture is a traumatic injury to the bone, typically caused by external force or trauma, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While a person with RA may potentially experience a fracture due to weakened bones from long-term inflammation, the presence of an open fracture does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Chronic bucket handle tear of lateral meniscus of left knee,765231,False,"No

Rationale: A chronic bucket handle tear of the lateral meniscus of the left knee is a specific condition related to a tear in the meniscus of the knee joint. While this condition may cause symptoms such as knee pain and swelling, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint destruction, and deformities. The presence of a meniscus tear does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Infective arthritis of left hip,42534829,False,"No, infective arthritis of the left hip is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is caused by an infection in the joint and is not an autoimmune condition like RA. While both conditions can present with joint pain and swelling, the underlying causes and treatment approaches are different. Infective arthritis requires prompt treatment with antibiotics to clear the infection, whereas RA is managed with anti-inflammatory medications and disease-modifying drugs."
Open fracture of intercondylar spine of right tibia,37310236,False,"No

Rationale: An open fracture of the intercondylar spine of the right tibia is a specific injury involving a fracture of the bone. While it may lead to complications such as infection or arthritis in the affected joint, it is not a specific condition associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder, not a direct result of a traumatic injury like an open fracture."
Infective arthritis of right shoulder,42534828,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Infective arthritis, on the other hand, is an infection of the joint that can occur in any joint, including the shoulder. While both conditions can present with joint swelling and tenderness, they have different underlying causes. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the right shoulder does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."

While both conditions can present with joint symptoms, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the left ankle does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of right hip,42534830,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While infective arthritis can also affect the joints, it is typically caused by an infection rather than an autoimmune response. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the right hip does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other factors such as clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings to make a definitive diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pigmented villonodular synovitis of joint of right knee,37207837,False,"No

Rationale:
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare, benign proliferative disorder of the synovium that can affect any joint in the body, most commonly the knee. While PVNS can cause joint swelling, pain, and stiffness similar to RA, it is not specific to RA. PVNS is not an autoimmune disease like RA, and the presence of PVNS does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Therefore, having PVNS of the joint of the right knee does not necessarily mean that a person has RA."
Bilateral inflammation of sacroiliac joint,761120,True,"Yes, bilateral inflammation of the sacroiliac joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Inflammation of the sacroiliac joint is a common feature of RA, particularly in the early stages of the disease. This symptom, along with other clinical criteria such as joint involvement and serological markers, can help in the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, RA is known to affect multiple joints symmetrically, including the sacroiliac joint. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral inflammation of the sacroiliac joint, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pigmented villonodular synovitis of joint of left knee,37207836,False,"No, pigmented villonodular synovitis of the joint of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pigmented villonodular synovitis is a rare, benign condition characterized by the proliferation of synovial tissue in joints, tendon sheaths, and bursae. It can cause pain, swelling, and limited range of motion in the affected joint.

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the joints and cause pain, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left foot due to trauma does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral arthritis of glenohumeral joints,42534861,True,"Yes, bilateral arthritis of the glenohumeral joints can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric, and the glenohumeral joints are commonly affected. Additionally, the presence of arthritis in multiple joints, including the glenohumeral joints, is a key feature of RA. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral arthritis of the glenohumeral joints, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right foot due to trauma,42534853,False,"No, arthritis of the right foot due to trauma is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can affect the joints of the feet, the presence of arthritis in the right foot due to trauma does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Trauma-induced arthritis is a separate condition caused by injury to the joint, rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA. Additional diagnostic criteria such as serological markers and imaging findings would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of RA in this case."
Arthritis of left foot due to trauma,42534854,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and it is not specifically caused by trauma. While trauma can lead to arthritis in the affected joint, it is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which is not specific to arthritis of the left foot due to trauma. Therefore, having arthritis of the left foot due to trauma does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right midtarsal joint,42534864,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of right midtarsal joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is known to primarily affect the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. The presence of arthritis in the midtarsal joint, which is located in the foot, is consistent with the pattern of joint involvement seen in RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are symptoms that can manifest in the midtarsal joint in patients with RA. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the right midtarsal joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Celiac disease with epilepsy and cerebral calcification syndrome,36716394,False,"No, the condition ""Celiac disease with epilepsy and cerebral calcification syndrome"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions are autoimmune disorders, they affect different systems in the body. Celiac disease primarily affects the gastrointestinal system, causing damage to the small intestine when gluten is consumed, while Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the joints. Additionally, the presence of epilepsy and cerebral calcification syndrome in the condition further distinguishes it from Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having the condition does not definitively mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral medial epicondylitis of elbows,761175,False,"No

Rationale: Bilateral medial epicondylitis of the elbows is a condition characterized by inflammation of the tendons on the inner side of the elbow. While this condition can cause pain and discomfort in the affected area, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis.

Villonodular synovitis is a rare, benign, proliferative disorder of the synovium that can affect any joint in the body, including the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger. It is characterized by the formation of a mass within the joint that can cause pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. While it can sometimes be associated with inflammatory conditions like RA, it is not a defining feature of RA. Therefore, having Villonodular synovitis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital genu recurvatum of right knee,761276,False,"No

Rationale:
Congenital genu recurvatum of the right knee is a condition characterized by hyperextension of the knee joint beyond the normal range. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) as it is a structural abnormality of the knee joint present from birth, rather than a symptom or sign of RA. While individuals with RA may experience joint deformities, including hyperextension of the knee, the presence of congenital genu recurvatum of the right knee does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Villonodular synovitis of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger,4117895,True,"Yes, the condition of Villonodular synovitis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Villonodular synovitis is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of synovial tissue in joints, leading to pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the synovial joints are primarily affected, and the presence of Villonodular synovitis in the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger would be consistent with the joint involvement seen in RA. Therefore, if a patient has Villonodular synovitis in this specific joint, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Villonodular synovitis of metacarpophalangeal joint,4117893,True,"Yes, Villonodular synovitis of the metacarpophalangeal joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Villonodular synovitis is a rare benign proliferative disorder of the synovium that can occur in the joints, including the metacarpophalangeal joint. In the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the presence of Villonodular synovitis in the metacarpophalangeal joint can be a manifestation of the chronic inflammatory process characteristic of RA. Therefore, if a patient has Villonodular synovitis of the metacarpophalangeal joint, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital genu valgum of bilateral knees,761271,False,"No, congenital genu valgum of bilateral knees is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Congenital genu valgum refers to a condition where the knees angle inwards and is present from birth. This is a structural abnormality of the knees and is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that characterizes Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have congenital genu valgum, the presence of congenital genu valgum does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hemarthrosis of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger,4117891,True,"Yes, hemarthrosis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hemarthrosis, which is bleeding into a joint, can occur in RA due to the inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints. In RA, the small joints of the hands, including the proximal interphalangeal joints, are commonly affected. Therefore, if a patient presents with hemarthrosis in this specific joint, it could be a strong indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."

Therefore, having a contracture of a joint of the finger of the left hand due to a scar does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of joint of finger of right hand due to scar,761490,False,"No

Rationale: Contracture of a joint of the finger of the right hand due to a scar is a specific condition that can result from various causes such as trauma, surgery, or burns. While it can lead to joint stiffness and limited range of motion, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having a contracture of a joint of the finger of the right hand due to a scar does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral acquired varus deformity of knees,36687030,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral acquired varus deformity of knees can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction and deformities are common, and varus deformity of the knees can occur as a result of chronic inflammation and damage to the joint structures. This deformity is often seen in advanced stages of RA and can lead to functional impairment. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral acquired varus deformity of the knees, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause."
Chronic disruption of cruciate ligament of right knee,761489,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While joint involvement is a key feature of RA, chronic disruption of the cruciate ligament of the right knee is a specific injury to the ligament in the knee joint and is not a characteristic symptom or feature of RA. Therefore, having a chronic disruption of the cruciate ligament of the right knee does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic disruption of cruciate ligament of left knee,761488,False,"No

Rationale:
Chronic disruption of the cruciate ligament of the left knee is a specific condition related to knee ligament injury and does not directly correlate with Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may experience joint pain and swelling in various joints, including the knees, the specific condition of chronic disruption of the cruciate ligament is not a defining characteristic of RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by autoimmune inflammation, joint destruction, and deformities, rather than specific ligament injuries."
Synovial plica syndrome of bilateral knees,761493,False,"No, synovial plica syndrome of bilateral knees is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovial plica syndrome is a condition where the synovial plica, a fold in the synovial membrane of the knee joint, becomes irritated or inflamed, causing pain and discomfort. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, synovial plica syndrome is a separate and distinct condition that can occur in isolation or in conjunction with other knee issues. Therefore, having synovial plica syndrome of bilateral knees does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Onychia of finger,444057,False,"No

Rationale: Onychia of the finger, which refers to inflammation of the nail matrix, is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can present with joint swelling and deformities in the fingers, onychia itself is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having onychia of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."

Rationale: Tendinitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the second toe of the right foot is a specific condition related to inflammation of the tendon in that particular area. While joint pain and swelling are common symptoms in both tendinitis and rheumatoid arthritis, tendinitis is a localized condition affecting the tendon, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having tendinitis in the specific area mentioned does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Tendinitis of metatarsophalangeal joint of second toe of left foot,36686982,False,"No

Rationale:
Tendinitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the second toe of the left foot is a specific condition related to inflammation of the tendon in that particular joint. While joint pain and inflammation are common symptoms in both tendinitis and rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of tendinitis in this specific joint does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, and a diagnosis of RA requires a combination of clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings. Therefore, having tendinitis in the metatarsophalangeal joint of the second toe of the left foot does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Disorder of joint of right ankle,761504,True,"Yes, the condition ""Disorder of joint of right ankle"" could be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. In this case, the specific joint mentioned (right ankle) could be a manifestation of RA, especially if there are other joints involved as well. Additionally, joint involvement is a key clinical criterion for diagnosing RA. Therefore, if a patient has a disorder in the joint of the right ankle, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital dislocation of right knee,36686979,False,"No, congenital dislocation of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Congenital dislocation of the knee is a condition that is present at birth and involves the abnormal positioning of the knee joint. It is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that is Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially have other joint issues, congenital dislocation of the knee is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Bilateral arthritis of first metatarsophalangeal joints,36687007,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joints is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This is because one of the characteristic features of RA is symmetric polyarthritis, which can involve the small joints of the hands and feet, including the first metatarsophalangeal joints. Additionally, the presence of arthritis in these specific joints can be a key clinical criterion for diagnosing RA. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joints, it strongly suggests the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Sexually acquired reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot,4066956,False,"No

Rationale: Sexually acquired reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot is a condition that typically occurs following a genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection, such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Salmonella. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a reactive arthritis that is triggered by an infection rather than an autoimmune disorder like RA. While some symptoms may overlap with RA, such as joint pain and swelling, the underlying cause and pathophysiology are different. Therefore, having sexually acquired reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral capsulitis of metatarsophalangeal joint of feet,36687004,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral capsulitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the feet is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis commonly presents with joint involvement, including the small joints of the hands and feet. Capsulitis, which is inflammation of the joint capsule, is a common manifestation of RA and can occur in the metatarsophalangeal joints of the feet. The bilateral nature of the condition (affecting both sides) is also consistent with the symmetric polyarthritis seen in RA. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral capsulitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the feet, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Sexually acquired reactive arthropathy of the shoulder region,4066954,False,"No

Rationale: Sexually acquired reactive arthropathy of the shoulder region is a specific condition related to a reactive arthritis that occurs after a genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings that differentiate it from other types of arthritis. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria."
Osteoarthritis of hip co-occurrent and due to dysplasia,37395586,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis of the hip due to dysplasia is a specific condition that is different from Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and characteristics. Osteoarthritis of the hip due to dysplasia is primarily caused by abnormal development of the hip joint, leading to degeneration of the joint cartilage over time. In contrast, Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the hip due to dysplasia does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of right elbow,765622,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the right elbow can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the elbows. The presence of arthropathy in the right elbow could be indicative of RA, especially if there are other signs and symptoms consistent with the disease, such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. Further evaluation with serological markers and imaging studies would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RA."
Acquired bilateral genu recurvatum,37209335,False,"No

Rationale: Acquired bilateral genu recurvatum is a condition characterized by hyperextension of the knees, causing the legs to bend backward. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it can be caused by various factors such as muscle weakness, ligament laxity, or neurological conditions. While it may be present in some patients with RA due to joint deformities and functional impairment, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having acquired bilateral genu recurvatum does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of vertebra due to renal impairment,46273541,False,"No

Rationale: Gout of vertebra due to renal impairment is a specific condition related to gout and renal impairment, not rheumatoid arthritis. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint disorders, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Gout is caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain, while rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having gout of vertebra due to renal impairment does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthropathy of joint of left hand,36676839,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthropathy of joint of left hand"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetrical and can affect small joints, such as those in the hands. The presence of arthropathy in the left hand suggests joint inflammation and damage, which are characteristic features of RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which align with the arthropathy of the joint in the left hand. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy in the joint of the left hand, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of left foot,37108990,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the left foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetrical and can affect small joints, including those in the feet. Therefore, if a patient presents with arthropathy in the left foot, it could be indicative of RA, especially when considering the characteristic joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction seen in this condition. However, further evaluation with serological markers and imaging findings would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RA."
Bilateral foot arthropathy,37108991,True,"Yes, bilateral foot arthropathy is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric, and the small joints of the hands and feet are commonly affected. Bilateral foot arthropathy refers to arthritis affecting both feet, which is a common manifestation of RA. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral foot arthropathy, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause."
Arthropathy of joint of right hand,36676838,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthropathy of joint of right hand"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In Rheumatoid Arthritis, joint involvement is typically symmetric and commonly affects the small joints of the hands and feet. The presence of arthropathy in the joint of the right hand aligns with the characteristic joint involvement seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy in the joint of the right hand, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acquired valgus deformity of left knee,36685029,False,"No, acquired valgus deformity of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Valgus deformity of the knee refers to a condition where the knee angles outward, away from the midline of the body. While joint deformities can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis, valgus deformity of the knee is not a specific characteristic of this condition. It can be caused by various factors such as trauma, osteoarthritis, or other inflammatory conditions. Therefore, the presence of acquired valgus deformity of the left knee does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of right foot,37108989,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the right foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetrical and can affect multiple joints, including those in the feet. The presence of arthropathy in the right foot could be indicative of RA, especially if other joints are also affected.

Therefore, the condition of arthropathy of the right foot could be a sign of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acquired valgus deformity of right knee,36685028,False,"No

Rationale: An acquired valgus deformity of the right knee is a specific physical finding related to the alignment of the knee joint, which can be caused by various factors such as trauma, osteoarthritis, or ligament injuries. While rheumatoid arthritis can lead to joint deformities, it typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, not just the right knee. Therefore, the presence of an acquired valgus deformity of the right knee alone is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of sacroiliac joint,4067057,True,"Yes, reactive arthropathy of the sacroiliac joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy refers to joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, inflammation can affect the sacroiliac joint, leading to symptoms such as pain, stiffness, and swelling in the lower back and buttocks. Therefore, if a patient has reactive arthropathy of the sacroiliac joint, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral rheumatoid nodule of subcutaneous tissue of hands,37209312,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral rheumatoid nodule of subcutaneous tissue of hands is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are a characteristic feature of RA and are typically found in areas of pressure or trauma, such as the hands. These nodules are not present in other forms of arthritis, making them a specific indicator of RA. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral rheumatoid nodules of the subcutaneous tissue of the hands, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of bilateral hips caused by bacteria,37209324,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis of bilateral hips caused by bacteria suggests an infectious etiology rather than an autoimmune one. While RA can affect multiple joints, including the hips, the specific cause of arthritis in this case is bacterial infection, which is not a characteristic feature of RA. Therefore, having arthritis of bilateral hips caused by bacteria does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral osteoarthritis of temporomandibular joints,37209320,False,"No

Rationale: Bilateral osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joints is a specific condition affecting the jaw joints, which is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it typically presents with joint involvement in the hands and feet, rather than the temporomandibular joints. Therefore, having bilateral osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joints does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of bilateral first carpometacarpal joints,37117138,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of bilateral first carpometacarpal joints"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is known to primarily affect the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands. The involvement of the first carpometacarpal joints in arthritis is a common manifestation of RA, as it often presents with joint pain and swelling in the hands. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the bilateral first carpometacarpal joints, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral rheumatoid nodule of subcutaneous tissue of elbows,37209311,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral rheumatoid nodule of subcutaneous tissue of elbows is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are a characteristic feature of RA and are typically found in areas of pressure or trauma, such as the elbows. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral rheumatoid nodules in the subcutaneous tissue of the elbows, it strongly suggests the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital deformity of right knee joint,37209308,False,"No

Rationale: A congenital deformity of the right knee joint is a structural abnormality present at birth affecting the right knee joint. While this condition may cause joint deformity and functional impairment, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The presence of a congenital deformity of the right knee joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bacterial arthritis of elbow,4196020,True,"Yes, bacterial arthritis of the elbow is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Bacterial arthritis is an infection of the joint caused by bacteria, which is a separate condition from RA. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune disease, bacterial arthritis is caused by an infection. Therefore, having bacterial arthritis of the elbow does not necessarily mean that a person has RA."
Arthritis of left foot caused by bacteria,36685016,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left foot caused by bacteria"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis caused by bacteria is typically a result of an infection in the joint. While RA can lead to joint damage and deformities, it is not directly caused by bacteria. Therefore, having arthritis of the left foot caused by bacteria does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right foot caused by bacteria,36685015,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right foot caused by bacteria"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint destruction and deformities, it is an autoimmune disease, not caused by bacteria. The presence of bacteria causing arthritis in the right foot would suggest a different type of arthritis, such as septic arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis of the right foot caused by bacteria does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic rheumatoid nodular fibrosis,40639636,True,"Yes, chronic rheumatoid nodular fibrosis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid nodules are a common extra-articular manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, characterized by firm, non-tender subcutaneous nodules that typically develop over pressure points or areas of trauma. These nodules are composed of fibroblasts, collagen, and inflammatory cells, and can persist for long periods of time. Therefore, the presence of chronic rheumatoid nodular fibrosis is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthrofibrosis of right knee,37117132,False,"No

Rationale:
Arthrofibrosis of the right knee is a condition characterized by excessive scar tissue formation within the knee joint, leading to stiffness and limited range of motion. While arthrofibrosis can occur as a complication of various knee surgeries or injuries, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having arthrofibrosis of the right knee does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Loose body in bilateral knee joints,37209292,False,"No

Rationale: A loose body in bilateral knee joints is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While it is possible for individuals with RA to develop loose bodies in their joints due to joint damage and inflammation, this condition can also occur in other types of arthritis, joint injuries, or conditions such as osteoarthritis. Therefore, the presence of a loose body in bilateral knee joints does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Undifferentiated spondylitis,4163267,False,"No, undifferentiated spondylitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Undifferentiated spondylitis refers to a type of spondyloarthritis that does not meet the criteria for a specific subtype such as ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis. While both Rheumatoid Arthritis and undifferentiated spondylitis are inflammatory conditions that can affect the joints, they are distinct entities with different diagnostic criteria and characteristics. Therefore, having undifferentiated spondylitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Medial epicondyle apophysitis of right elbow due to overuse,37108939,False,"No

Rationale: Medial epicondyle apophysitis of the right elbow due to overuse is a condition commonly seen in young athletes, particularly baseball pitchers, and is characterized by pain and inflammation at the medial epicondyle of the elbow. While this condition may cause joint pain and discomfort, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and the symptoms and diagnostic criteria for RA are different from those of medial epicondyle apophysitis. Therefore, having medial epicondyle apophysitis of the right elbow due to overuse does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Bilateral arthropathy of joint of hands,36687056,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral arthropathy of joints of the hands is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetrical, and the small joints of the hands are commonly affected.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while arthritis of the lower limb due to parasitic infection is caused by a parasitic infection. The two conditions have different etiologies and mechanisms of action, making them distinct entities."
Bilateral arthritis of knees caused by Staphylococcus,37309745,False,"No, the condition of bilateral arthritis of knees caused by Staphylococcus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This specific condition is caused by a bacterial infection (Staphylococcus) rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA. While RA can also affect the knees and cause arthritis, the presence of Staphylococcus as the causative agent in this condition indicates a different etiology altogether. Therefore, having bilateral arthritis of knees caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral arthritis of wrists caused by Bacteria,37309744,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition of bilateral arthritis of wrists caused by bacteria suggests an infectious etiology rather than an autoimmune one. While joint involvement can be a feature of both conditions, the underlying cause and pathophysiology are different. Therefore, having bilateral arthritis of wrists caused by bacteria does not necessarily mean that one definitely has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left temporomandibular joint,36687162,False,"No

Rationale: Arthritis of the left temporomandibular joint is a specific condition affecting the joint connecting the jaw to the skull. While it is a form of arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, such as those in the hands and feet, and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation. Therefore, having arthritis of the left temporomandibular joint does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of right temporomandibular joint,36687161,False,"No, arthritis of the right temporomandibular joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet, arthritis of the temporomandibular joint is a separate condition that affects the jaw joint. It is more commonly associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis or trauma to the joint. Therefore, having arthritis of the right temporomandibular joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral infective arthritis of knees,37309743,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas bilateral infective arthritis of knees suggests an acute infection in the knee joints. While RA can present with joint swelling and tenderness, the specific mention of an infection in the knees would not be characteristic of RA. Additionally, the presence of an infection would be more indicative of an acute condition rather than a chronic autoimmune disorder like RA. Therefore, having bilateral infective arthritis of knees does not necessarily mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Capsulitis of bilateral temporomandibular joints,36687160,False,"No, capsulitis of bilateral temporomandibular joints is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Capsulitis of the temporomandibular joints refers to inflammation of the joint capsule in the jaw, which can cause pain, limited range of motion, and clicking or popping sounds in the jaw. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect multiple joints in the body, including the temporomandibular joints, capsulitis of the temporomandibular joints can have various causes such as trauma, bruxism (teeth grinding), or arthritis other than RA. Therefore, having capsulitis of the temporomandibular joints does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of joint of left wrist,37209351,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthropathy of joint of left wrist"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetrical and can affect multiple joints, including the wrists. The presence of arthropathy in the left wrist suggests joint inflammation and damage, which are characteristic features of RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are consistent with arthropathy. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy of the joint of the left wrist, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left subtalar joint,37108996,False,"No

Rationale: Arthritis of the left subtalar joint is a specific condition affecting a specific joint in the foot, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. While it is possible for someone with Rheumatoid Arthritis to also have arthritis in the subtalar joint, the presence of arthritis in the left subtalar joint alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right subtalar joint,37108997,True,"Yes, arthritis of the right subtalar joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect various joints in the body, including the subtalar joint. The presence of arthritis in the subtalar joint, especially in the context of other symptoms and diagnostic criteria for RA, can suggest a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, it is important to consider other factors such as serological markers and imaging findings to confirm the diagnosis."
Autoimmune enteropathy,4341626,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Autoimmune enteropathy, on the other hand, is a rare autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the intestines, leading to chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss. These two conditions involve different organ systems and have distinct clinical presentations, so having autoimmune enteropathy does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nonspecific polyarthritis,44811664,False,"No

Rationale: Nonspecific polyarthritis is a general term used to describe joint pain and inflammation affecting multiple joints, without specifying a particular underlying cause. While rheumatoid arthritis is a specific type of polyarthritis characterized by autoimmune inflammation and joint destruction, nonspecific polyarthritis does not definitively point to RA as the cause. Other conditions such as osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and infectious arthritis can also present with polyarthritis. Therefore, having nonspecific polyarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person definitely has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthropathy of bilateral ankle joints,37209355,True,"Yes, arthropathy of bilateral ankle joints can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the ankles. The presence of arthropathy in both ankle joints aligns with the characteristic polyarthritis seen in RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which can manifest in the ankle joints as well. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy of bilateral ankle joints, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosis of bilateral knee joints,37209354,True,"Yes, ankylosis of bilateral knee joints is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosis refers to the fusion of the bones in a joint, leading to loss of mobility and function. In Rheumatoid Arthritis, chronic inflammation and destruction of the joints can eventually lead to ankylosis, particularly in the knees. This condition is a result of the progressive joint damage and deformities seen in RA, making it a specific manifestation of this malady."
Arthropathy of bilateral wrist joints,37209353,True,"Yes, arthropathy of bilateral wrist joints can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetrical, and the wrist joints are commonly affected. The presence of arthropathy in both wrist joints can be a strong indicator of RA, especially when combined with other clinical criteria such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. Additionally, imaging findings such as joint erosions on X-ray can further support the diagnosis of RA in this case. Therefore, if a patient presents with arthropathy of bilateral wrist joints, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of joint of right wrist,37209352,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthropathy of joint of right wrist"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetrical and can affect multiple joints, including the wrists. The presence of arthropathy in the right wrist suggests joint inflammation and damage, which are characteristic features of RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are consistent with arthropathy. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy of the joint of the right wrist, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile osteochondritis of the arm and hand,4145018,False,"No, juvenile osteochondritis of the arm and hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile osteochondritis is a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the cartilage and bone in the joints of the arm and hand, typically affecting children and adolescents. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune disease, juvenile osteochondritis is a separate condition that is not directly linked to RA. The symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches for these two conditions are distinct, indicating that having juvenile osteochondritis of the arm and hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteochondritis of pelvis,4145017,False,"No. Osteochondritis of the pelvis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteochondritis is a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the bone and cartilage in a joint. While it can cause joint pain and stiffness, it is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune disorder, whereas osteochondritis is a separate condition involving the bone and cartilage. Therefore, having osteochondritis of the pelvis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infection associated with prosthesis of left knee joint,37309800,True,"Yes, the condition ""Infection associated with prosthesis of left knee joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis who have undergone knee joint replacement surgery, there is an increased risk of developing infections associated with the prosthesis due to the chronic inflammatory nature of the disease and the immunosuppressive medications used to manage it. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis presents with an infection associated with the prosthesis of the left knee joint, it is highly likely that the infection is related to their underlying Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger,40486203,True,"Yes, the condition of infective arthritis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Infective arthritis refers to a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection of a joint, which can lead to joint inflammation, pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the primary pathology is autoimmune in nature, affecting the synovial joints symmetrically and leading to joint destruction and deformities. While infective arthritis can present with similar symptoms of joint pain and swelling, the underlying cause is different. 

Therefore, if a patient has infective arthritis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger, it does not necessarily mean they have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, if a patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis, they may develop infective arthritis as a complication due to the chronic inflammation and immune system dysfunction associated with RA."
Strain of left patellar tendon,36687224,False,"No

Rationale: A strain of the left patellar tendon is a specific injury to the tendon connecting the patella (kneecap) to the tibia. While this condition may cause knee pain and discomfort, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and deformities. Therefore, having a strain of the left patellar tendon does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Strain of right patellar tendon,36687223,False,"No, a strain of the right patellar tendon is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A strain of the right patellar tendon is a localized injury to the tendon connecting the patella (kneecap) to the tibia (shinbone) and is typically caused by overuse or sudden movements. It is not a systemic autoimmune disease like Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain in various parts of the body, a strain of the right patellar tendon is a specific injury to the knee area and does not necessarily indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Late onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis,4083558,True,"Yes, late onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Late onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that presents in adulthood. It is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis. The term ""juvenile"" in the condition name refers to the age of onset rather than the age of presentation. Therefore, if someone has late onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of right ankle due to trauma,37109100,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the articular cartilage, leading to joint pain and stiffness. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect joints and cause pain, they have different underlying mechanisms and treatment approaches. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right ankle due to trauma does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Late onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis,4083557,True,"Yes, late onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Late onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis refers to a form of arthritis that affects a small number of joints and develops later in life. This description aligns with the characteristics of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a person has late onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Solitary sacroiliitis,73562,True,"Yes, solitary sacroiliitis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Sacroiliitis refers to inflammation of the sacroiliac joint, which is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, inflammation can affect multiple joints, including the sacroiliac joint. Therefore, if a patient has solitary sacroiliitis, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of sacroiliitis, such as ankylosing spondylitis or infection, and to perform further evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of RA."
Arthritis of right ankle due to trauma,37109098,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right ankle due to trauma"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it can also be caused by other factors such as trauma or injury. In this case, the arthritis in the right ankle is specifically attributed to trauma, rather than being a result of the autoimmune inflammatory disorder characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis in the right ankle due to trauma does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of left ankle due to trauma,37109099,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left ankle due to trauma does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of joint of finger,4083553,True,"Yes, contracture of joint of finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction can lead to deformities and functional impairment, including contractures of the joints. Contractures in the fingers are commonly seen in patients with RA due to the chronic inflammation and damage to the joints. Therefore, if a patient has contracture of joint of finger, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause."
Reactive arthropathy of 1st metatarsophalangeal joint,4065104,False,"No, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of 1st metatarsophalangeal joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy refers to joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition. In this case, the involvement of the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint suggests a different etiology, as RA typically presents with symmetrical polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, particularly in the hands and feet. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are not specifically mentioned in the condition provided. Therefore, the presence of reactive arthropathy of the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of interphalangeal joint of toe,4065105,True,"Yes, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of interphalangeal joint of toe"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Reactive arthropathy refers to joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, joint inflammation is a key feature of the disease, affecting multiple joints including the interphalangeal joints of the toes. The presence of reactive arthropathy in this specific joint is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it aligns with the characteristic joint involvement seen in the disease. Therefore, if a patient has reactive arthropathy of the interphalangeal joint of the toe, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral arthrofibrosis fibrosis of knees,36687198,True,"Yes, bilateral arthrofibrosis fibrosis of knees is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Arthrofibrosis is a condition characterized by excessive scar tissue formation within a joint, leading to stiffness and limited range of motion. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints can lead to arthrofibrosis in the knees. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral arthrofibrosis fibrosis of knees, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune disorder of inner ear,4337463,False,"No, the condition ""Autoimmune disorder of inner ear"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is an autoimmune disorder, it primarily affects the synovial joints and is not typically associated with inner ear disorders. Autoimmune inner ear diseases are a separate category of conditions that involve the immune system attacking the inner ear structures, leading to symptoms such as hearing loss, dizziness, and imbalance. While autoimmune disorders can coexist, having an autoimmune disorder of the inner ear does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Post-infective arthritis of joint of foot,4173757,False,"No, post-infective arthritis of the joint of the foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Post-infective arthritis refers to joint inflammation that occurs after an infection, typically caused by bacteria or viruses. While Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, post-infective arthritis is a result of an infection. Therefore, having post-infective arthritis of the joint of the foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pyogenic arthritis of foot,4288479,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Pyogenic arthritis, on the other hand, is a bacterial infection of a joint, leading to inflammation and joint damage. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having pyogenic arthritis of the foot does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of knee due to and following trauma,37311899,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis of the knee due to and following trauma is a specific condition that is distinct from Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions involve joint pain and swelling, osteoarthritis is primarily a degenerative joint disease caused by wear and tear on the joints, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Additionally, the presence of trauma as a cause for osteoarthritis in this specific condition further differentiates it from RA. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the knee due to and following trauma does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of wrist and hand due to and following trauma,37311898,False,"No, the condition ""Osteoarthritis of wrist and hand due to and following trauma"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that is primarily caused by wear and tear on the joints over time, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. In this case, the osteoarthritis is specifically attributed to trauma, which is a known risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints and is not directly caused by trauma. While both conditions can affect the hands and wrists, the underlying mechanisms and treatment approaches are different, making the condition not specific to the malady."
Osteoarthritis of hip due to and following trauma,37311900,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis of the hip due to and following trauma is a specific condition that is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, typically affecting weight-bearing joints such as the hips, knees, and spine. In this case, the osteoarthritis is directly linked to trauma, which is a different etiology than the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the hip joint, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms."
Infection associated with prosthesis of right knee joint,37309854,False,"No, the condition ""Infection associated with prosthesis of right knee joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While infections can occur in patients with RA, they are not a defining characteristic of the disease. Infections associated with prosthetic joints are more commonly seen in patients who have undergone joint replacement surgeries, regardless of whether they have RA or not. Therefore, having an infection associated with a prosthesis in the right knee joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Allergic arthritis of spine,4323203,False,"No, allergic arthritis of the spine is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Allergic arthritis is a type of arthritis that occurs as a result of an allergic reaction, typically to certain medications or foods. It is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is primarily characterized by symmetric polyarthritis affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having allergic arthritis of the spine does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Non-traumatic rupture of tendon of left patella,765915,False,"No

Rationale: A non-traumatic rupture of the tendon of the left patella is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can lead to joint damage and deformities, a rupture of the patellar tendon is a specific injury that can occur due to trauma or degenerative changes in the tendon itself. It is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Arthritis of left ankle due to trauma,37117422,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left ankle due to trauma"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While trauma can lead to arthritis in the affected joint, Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints and is not directly caused by trauma. Additionally, the description of Rheumatoid Arthritis mentions specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings that are used to diagnose the condition, none of which are mentioned in the condition provided."
Reactive arthropathy of tibiofibular joint,4067300,False,"No, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of tibiofibular joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy refers to joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In this case, the involvement of the tibiofibular joint suggests a different etiology than Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints. Additionally, the description of Rheumatoid Arthritis does not mention reactive arthropathy as a common feature of the disease. Therefore, having reactive arthropathy of the tibiofibular joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of ankle,4067301,False,"No.

Rationale:
Reactive arthropathy of the ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy is a term used to describe joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In this case, the condition is specific to an inflammatory response in the ankle joint, which can be triggered by various factors such as infections, trauma, or other autoimmune conditions. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including the ankles, the presence of reactive arthropathy in the ankle does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of RA in this case."
Synovitis of knee,4083683,True,"Yes, synovitis of the knee can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis, which is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, is a common feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is a key component of the disease process, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient has synovitis of the knee, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis, although further evaluation and diagnostic criteria would be needed to confirm the diagnosis."
"Immune dysregulation, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, recurrent infection syndrome",36675057,True,"Yes, the condition ""arthritis"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a specific type of arthritis characterized by autoimmune inflammation of the synovial joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if someone has the condition of arthritis, particularly with symptoms such as symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling and morning stiffness, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile ankylosing spondylitis,4083681,False,"No, juvenile ankylosing spondylitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, causing inflammation and stiffness. It is not the same as Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints. While both conditions are autoimmune inflammatory disorders, they have different clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having juvenile ankylosing spondylitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent monoarthritis",37207517,True,"Yes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent monoarthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders affecting children under the age of 16. Persistent monoarthritis refers to inflammation in a single joint that lasts for an extended period of time. In the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), persistent monoarthritis can be a presenting symptom, particularly in the early stages of the disease. RA can initially manifest as inflammation in a single joint before progressing to involve multiple joints. Therefore, if a patient has juvenile idiopathic arthritis with persistent monoarthritis, it is highly suggestive of RA as the underlying cause."
Medial epicondyle apophysitis due to overuse,45757777,False,"No

Rationale: Medial epicondyle apophysitis due to overuse is a condition commonly seen in young athletes, particularly baseball pitchers, and is characterized by pain and inflammation at the medial epicondyle of the elbow. While this condition may cause joint pain and swelling, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, with specific diagnostic criteria including symmetric polyarthritis, serological markers, and joint erosions on imaging. Therefore, having medial epicondyle apophysitis due to overuse does not definitively mean that an individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent oligoarthritis",4132812,True,"Yes, the condition of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent oligoarthritis is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a type of arthritis that affects children and adolescents, and persistent oligoarthritis is a subtype characterized by arthritis in fewer than five joints. In some cases, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent oligoarthritis can progress to rheumatoid arthritis in adulthood. Therefore, if a person has juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent oligoarthritis, they may develop rheumatoid arthritis later in life."
Acute lymphangitis of finger,46269745,False,"No

Rationale: Acute lymphangitis of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute lymphangitis is an infection of the lymphatic vessels, typically caused by bacteria entering through a break in the skin. It is not a characteristic symptom or diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop acute lymphangitis of the finger, having acute lymphangitis of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, oligoarthritis",4132811,True,"Yes, the condition of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, oligoarthritis is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, oligoarthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that primarily affects fewer than five joints, often the knees. This condition is considered a form of autoimmune arthritis, similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis, and can lead to joint swelling, tenderness, and potential joint damage. Therefore, if a person has juvenile idiopathic arthritis, oligoarthritis, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
