Nerve palsy,37205047,False,"No, nerve palsy is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Nerve palsy refers to a loss of motor function in a nerve due to damage or dysfunction. While nerve damage can be a complication of diabetes, it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Nerve palsy can have various causes such as trauma, infection, inflammation, or other medical conditions. Therefore, the presence of nerve palsy does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Secondary hyperlipidemia,4292672,False,"No

Rationale:
Secondary hyperlipidemia is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may develop secondary hyperlipidemia as a complication of the disease, not all individuals with secondary hyperlipidemia will have T1DM. Secondary hyperlipidemia can be caused by various factors such as diet, medications, other medical conditions, or genetic factors. Therefore, having secondary hyperlipidemia does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Obesity in mother complicating childbirth,45757112,False,"No

Rationale: Obesity in the mother complicating childbirth is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While obesity can be a risk factor for developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, it is not a defining characteristic of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is specifically characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency, rather than being directly related to obesity."
End stage renal failure on dialysis,4030520,True,"Yes, end stage renal failure on dialysis can be specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale:
End stage renal failure is a common complication of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia in T1DM can lead to damage to the small blood vessels in the kidneys, resulting in diabetic nephropathy and eventually end stage renal failure. Patients with T1DM who develop end stage renal failure may require dialysis as a form of renal replacement therapy. Therefore, if a patient with T1DM has progressed to end stage renal failure requiring dialysis, it is highly likely that the condition is specific to the malady of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Mononeuropathy,4134455,False,"No

Rationale: Mononeuropathy is a condition characterized by damage to a single nerve, leading to weakness, numbness, and pain in a specific area of the body. While mononeuropathy can be a complication of diabetes, it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Mononeuropathy can occur in various other conditions such as trauma, compression, infection, or other systemic diseases. Therefore, having mononeuropathy does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Hypertensive renal failure,443919,False,"No, hypertensive renal failure is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at an increased risk for developing renal complications, including renal failure, hypertension can also lead to renal failure in individuals without diabetes. Hypertensive renal failure is a condition that can be caused by various factors, including high blood pressure, kidney disease, and other underlying health conditions. Therefore, the presence of hypertensive renal failure does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Open wound of foot,4054067,False,"No

Rationale:
An open wound of the foot is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1, are at an increased risk of developing foot ulcers due to complications such as neuropathy and poor circulation, an open wound of the foot can occur in individuals without diabetes as well. Therefore, having an open wound of the foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Macular edema not clinically significant due to diabetes mellitus,4162095,False,"No

Rationale: Macular edema not clinically significant due to diabetes mellitus is a specific condition that is associated with diabetes mellitus, but it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) specifically. Macular edema can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as other conditions that affect the retina. Therefore, having macular edema not clinically significant due to diabetes mellitus does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus without complications,4096042,False,"No

Rationale:
Malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus without complications is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While malnutrition can lead to diabetes, the specific autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells seen in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is not necessarily present in malnutrition-related diabetes. Additionally, the presence of autoantibodies against pancreatic beta cells, which is a hallmark of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, is not typically seen in malnutrition-related diabetes. Therefore, having malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus without complications does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Disorder of nervous system,376337,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of nervous system"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may experience complications related to the nervous system such as neuropathy, the presence of a disorder of the nervous system does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Many other medical conditions can also affect the nervous system, so further evaluation and testing would be needed to determine the underlying cause of the nervous system disorder."
Metabolic acidosis due to diabetes mellitus,42536605,True,"Yes, metabolic acidosis due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). In T1DM, the lack of insulin leads to the breakdown of fats for energy, resulting in the production of ketones which can cause metabolic acidosis. This is a common complication of T1DM and is not typically seen in other types of diabetes. Therefore, if a patient presents with metabolic acidosis due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM."
Lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus without complication,44787902,True,"Yes

Rationale:
Lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus is a rare form of diabetes characterized by the loss of subcutaneous fat, leading to insulin resistance and diabetes. This condition is specific to the malady of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus because it is a subtype of diabetes that falls under the umbrella of T1DM. In lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus, the loss of subcutaneous fat can lead to insulin deficiency, similar to the destruction of beta cells in T1DM. Therefore, if a person has lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus without complication, they definitely have the malady of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Peripheral vascular disease,321052,False,"No, peripheral vascular disease is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM are at an increased risk for developing peripheral vascular disease due to the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on blood vessels, peripheral vascular disease can also occur in individuals without diabetes. Peripheral vascular disease is a condition that affects the blood vessels outside of the heart and brain, typically causing symptoms such as leg pain, cramping, and poor wound healing. It can have various causes, including atherosclerosis, inflammation, and blood clotting disorders. Therefore, having peripheral vascular disease does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Anemia in mother complicating childbirth,45757092,False,"No, anemia in a mother complicating childbirth is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Anemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. While anemia can occur in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus due to various factors such as poor glycemic control or underlying autoimmune conditions, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, the presence of anemia in a mother complicating childbirth does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Disorder of macula of retina,4208223,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of macula of retina"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at an increased risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, which can affect the macula of the retina, the presence of a disorder of the macula of the retina does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Other conditions or factors can also lead to disorders of the macula of the retina, such as age-related macular degeneration or other retinal diseases. Therefore, the condition is not specific to the malady."
Necrosis of bone of lower leg co-occurrent and due to chronic ulcer of lower leg,37016107,False,"No, the condition ""Necrosis of bone of lower leg co-occurrent and due to chronic ulcer of lower leg"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may develop complications such as chronic ulcers due to poor circulation and nerve damage, necrosis of bone in the lower leg is not a direct symptom or complication specific to T1DM. This condition could be caused by a variety of factors such as peripheral vascular disease, infection, or trauma. It is important to consider a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause of the necrosis in this case."
Very severe nonproliferative retinopathy of left eye due to diabetes mellitus,35626047,True,"Yes, the condition of very severe nonproliferative retinopathy of the left eye due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, and the presence of retinopathy in this case indicates a long-standing history of uncontrolled diabetes, which is more commonly seen in Type 1 diabetes. Additionally, the description of the malady mentions complications such as retinopathy, further supporting the association between the condition and T1DM. Therefore, if a patient has very severe nonproliferative retinopathy of the left eye due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Hypoglycemia,24609,False,"No, hypoglycemia is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by low blood sugar levels, which can occur in individuals with T1DM due to insulin therapy or other factors. However, hypoglycemia can also occur in individuals without diabetes due to various reasons such as excessive alcohol consumption, certain medications, hormonal imbalances, or other medical conditions. Therefore, while hypoglycemia can be a symptom of T1DM, it is not specific to this malady."
Very severe nonproliferative retinopathy of right eye due to diabetes mellitus,35626046,True,"Yes, the condition of very severe nonproliferative retinopathy of the right eye due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, and the presence of very severe nonproliferative retinopathy specifically indicates long-standing and poorly controlled diabetes. Since T1DM is characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas leading to absolute insulin deficiency, it can result in severe complications such as retinopathy. Therefore, if a patient has very severe nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Severe nonproliferative retinopathy of left eye due to diabetes mellitus,35626044,True,"Yes, the condition of severe nonproliferative retinopathy of the left eye due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale: Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly in individuals with longstanding and poorly controlled diabetes. The presence of severe nonproliferative retinopathy in this case indicates long-standing and poorly controlled diabetes, which is more commonly seen in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus due to the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Therefore, if a patient has severe nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus, they most likely have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Severe nonproliferative retinopathy of right eye due to diabetes mellitus,35626043,True,"Yes, the condition of severe nonproliferative retinopathy of the right eye due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, and the presence of retinopathy in this case indicates a long-standing history of uncontrolled diabetes, which is characteristic of T1DM. Additionally, the description of T1DM mentions complications such as retinopathy, further supporting the association between the condition and the malady. Therefore, if a patient has severe nonproliferative retinopathy of the right eye due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have T1DM."
Disease of circulatory system complicating pregnancy childbirth and puerperium,37110290,False,"No, the condition ""Disease of circulatory system complicating pregnancy childbirth and puerperium"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may have complications related to the circulatory system, such as cardiovascular disease, this specific condition refers to complications during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period related to circulatory issues. It is not a defining characteristic of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Type 1 diabetes mellitus with arthropathy,4152858,False,"No

Rationale:
While arthropathy (joint disease) can occur in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), it is not a specific condition that definitively indicates the presence of T1DM. Arthropathy can be seen in various other conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, etc. Therefore, the presence of arthropathy alone does not confirm the diagnosis of T1DM."
Gas gangrene,433696,False,"No, gas gangrene is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Gas gangrene is a severe and potentially life-threatening infection of the muscle tissue caused by certain types of bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens. It is characterized by rapid onset of severe pain, swelling, and discoloration of the affected area, along with the production of gas within the tissues. Gas gangrene is not directly related to the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells seen in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes may be at a higher risk for infections, gas gangrene is not a specific condition associated with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis,4001819,False,"No

Rationale: Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is a bacterial infection of the bone that typically occurs in children and is characterized by bone pain, fever, and localized tenderness. While acute hematogenous osteomyelitis can occur in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, it is not specific to this condition. Therefore, having acute hematogenous osteomyelitis does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Hyperglycemia,4214376,True,"Yes, hyperglycemia is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Hyperglycemia is a hallmark feature of T1DM, as it is caused by the absolute insulin deficiency resulting from the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. In T1DM, the body is unable to regulate blood glucose levels properly, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Therefore, if someone has hyperglycemia, it is highly indicative of T1DM."
Gangrene of limb due to atherosclerosis of artery of limb,37312531,False,"No

Rationale: Gangrene of a limb due to atherosclerosis of an artery of the limb is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1, are at an increased risk for atherosclerosis and subsequent complications such as gangrene, this condition can also occur in individuals without diabetes. Therefore, having gangrene of a limb due to atherosclerosis of an artery of the limb does not definitively mean that the individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Retinal detachment,378414,False,"No

Rationale: Retinal detachment is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM are at an increased risk of developing retinopathy, which can lead to retinal detachment, not all cases of retinal detachment are directly linked to T1DM. Retinal detachment can occur due to various reasons such as trauma, aging, or other underlying eye conditions. Therefore, the presence of retinal detachment does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM."
Diabetes mellitus associated with pancreatic disease,4178452,False,"No

Rationale: While diabetes mellitus associated with pancreatic disease can cause hyperglycemia, it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. There are various types of diabetes mellitus, and the presence of pancreatic disease can lead to different forms of diabetes, not just Type 1. Therefore, having diabetes mellitus associated with pancreatic disease does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Autonomic neuropathy,4080146,False,"No

Rationale: Autonomic neuropathy is a potential complication of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), but it is not specific to T1DM. Autonomic neuropathy can also occur in other conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, alcoholism, autoimmune diseases, and certain infections. Therefore, having autonomic neuropathy does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Ulcer of skin of lower extremity,46272749,False,"No

Rationale: An ulcer of the skin of the lower extremity is a non-specific condition that can have various causes, such as poor circulation, venous insufficiency, arterial disease, or diabetes. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at increased risk for developing ulcers due to complications such as neuropathy and poor wound healing, the presence of an ulcer of the skin of the lower extremity does not definitively indicate Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, having an ulcer of the skin of the lower extremity does not specifically mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Gangrene of left lower limb due to atherosclerosis,36712963,False,"No

Rationale: Gangrene of the left lower limb due to atherosclerosis is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1, are at an increased risk for atherosclerosis and subsequent complications such as gangrene, the presence of gangrene due to atherosclerosis does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Other conditions and risk factors can also lead to atherosclerosis and gangrene."
Non centrally involved macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,3656195,True,"Yes, the condition of non-centrally involved macular edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Macular edema is a common complication of diabetes, and in the case of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the chronic hyperglycemia can lead to damage of the blood vessels in the retina, resulting in macular edema. Therefore, if a patient has non-centrally involved macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Centrally involved macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,3656194,True,"Yes, centrally involved macular edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale: Macular edema is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly in patients with longstanding hyperglycemia. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the chronic hyperglycemia can lead to damage to the blood vessels in the retina, resulting in macular edema. Therefore, if a patient has centrally involved macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Retinal disorder,378416,False,"No

Rationale: A retinal disorder is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at risk for developing retinopathy as a complication of the disease, not all individuals with retinal disorders have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Retinal disorders can have various causes such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy (which can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus), retinal detachment, etc. Therefore, having a retinal disorder does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Moderate nonproliferative retinopathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,45770881,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, moderate nonproliferative retinopathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus, specifically mentions type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is a different type of diabetes than type 1 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, this condition is not specific to the malady of type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Lesion of skin of foot,46269695,False,"No

Rationale: A lesion of the skin of the foot is a non-specific condition that can have various causes, such as trauma, infection, or dermatological conditions. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at an increased risk for foot complications due to neuropathy and vascular issues, the presence of a skin lesion on the foot alone does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM. It is important to consider other factors and symptoms in addition to the skin lesion to make a diagnosis of T1DM."
Albuminuria,4168705,True,"Yes, albuminuria can be specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Albuminuria is the presence of albumin in the urine, which is a marker of kidney damage. In T1DM, prolonged hyperglycemia can lead to damage to the small blood vessels in the kidneys, resulting in albuminuria. Therefore, if a patient with T1DM has albuminuria, it is highly likely that it is due to their diabetes. However, it is important to note that not all cases of albuminuria are due to T1DM, as other conditions such as hypertension and kidney disease can also cause albuminuria."
Diffuse exudative maculopathy due to diabetes mellitus,4199039,True,"Yes

Rationale: Diffuse exudative maculopathy due to diabetes mellitus is a specific condition that is directly related to diabetes mellitus. In this case, the presence of diffuse exudative maculopathy would indicate the presence of diabetes mellitus, specifically Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This condition is a complication of diabetes that affects the macula, the central part of the retina, and is a result of the chronic hyperglycemia and microvascular changes associated with diabetes. Therefore, if a patient has diffuse exudative maculopathy due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Preterm labor in third trimester with preterm delivery in third trimester,45757176,False,"No, preterm labor in the third trimester with preterm delivery in the third trimester is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Preterm labor and delivery are not typically associated with T1DM. Preterm labor and delivery can be caused by various factors such as infections, cervical insufficiency, multiple pregnancies, and certain maternal health conditions, but it is not a defining characteristic of T1DM."
At risk of ulcer of foot due to diabetes mellitus,37018224,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""At risk of ulcer of foot due to diabetes mellitus"" suggests a potential complication of diabetes mellitus, specifically related to the feet. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at an increased risk of developing foot ulcers due to complications such as neuropathy and poor circulation, not all individuals with T1DM will develop foot ulcers. Therefore, having the condition does not definitively mean that the individual has T1DM. On the other hand, individuals with T1DM may or may not have the specific condition of being at risk of foot ulcers. So, the condition is not specific to the malady of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Mixed diabetic ulcer - foot,4066936,False,"No

Rationale: A mixed diabetic ulcer on the foot is a specific complication of diabetes, but it is not a defining characteristic of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at an increased risk for developing diabetic ulcers due to complications such as neuropathy and poor circulation, the presence of a mixed diabetic ulcer on the foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Macular edema due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,35626070,False,"No

Rationale: Macular edema is a complication commonly associated with diabetes, but specifically with type 2 diabetes mellitus, not type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency, whereas type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Therefore, macular edema due to type 2 diabetes mellitus would not be specific to type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Very severe nonproliferative retinopathy without macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,4221962,True,"Yes, the condition of very severe nonproliferative retinopathy without macular edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, and the presence of very severe nonproliferative retinopathy without macular edema is a serious manifestation of long-standing uncontrolled diabetes. In the case of T1DM, the chronic hyperglycemia and lack of insulin production can lead to damage to the blood vessels in the retina, resulting in retinopathy. 

Therefore, if an individual has very severe nonproliferative retinopathy without macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Disorder of phosphorus metabolism,435788,False,"No, a disorder of phosphorus metabolism is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may experience various metabolic abnormalities, including disturbances in phosphorus metabolism, the presence of a disorder of phosphorus metabolism does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Phosphorus metabolism disorders can be caused by a variety of factors unrelated to diabetes, such as kidney disease, hormonal imbalances, or certain medications. Therefore, the condition of a disorder of phosphorus metabolism is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Poorly controlled type I diabetes with neuropathy,3192955,True,"Yes, the condition of poorly controlled type I diabetes with neuropathy is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

The presence of neuropathy, which is nerve damage resulting in symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or pain in the extremities, is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in poorly controlled cases. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency, resulting in hyperglycemia. Over time, this chronic hyperglycemia can lead to complications such as neuropathy. Therefore, if someone has poorly controlled Type 1 Diabetes with neuropathy, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Macular edema of left eye due to diabetes mellitus,35626068,True,"Yes, the condition of macular edema of the left eye due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Macular edema is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in patients with longstanding hyperglycemia. In T1DM, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells leads to uncontrolled blood glucose levels, which can damage blood vessels in the eye and result in macular edema. Therefore, if a patient has macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM."
Macular edema of right eye due to diabetes mellitus,35626067,True,"Yes, the condition of macular edema of the right eye due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Macular edema is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in patients with longstanding uncontrolled diabetes. In T1DM, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency, resulting in hyperglycemia. Chronic hyperglycemia can damage blood vessels in the retina, leading to diabetic retinopathy, which can progress to macular edema. Therefore, if a patient has macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM."
Glaucoma due to diabetes mellitus,3655269,False,"No

Rationale: Glaucoma due to diabetes mellitus is a specific condition that can occur as a complication of diabetes mellitus, but not all individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus will develop glaucoma. Therefore, having glaucoma due to diabetes mellitus does not necessarily mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Absent foot,4097128,False,"No, the condition ""Absent foot"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, are at an increased risk for foot complications such as neuropathy and ulcers, the presence of an absent foot is not a defining characteristic of T1DM. Absent foot could be due to a variety of other causes such as traumatic injury, congenital anomalies, vascular disease, or other medical conditions. Therefore, the presence of an absent foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Myxedema neuropathy,4044394,False,"No

Rationale:
Myxedema neuropathy is a rare complication of severe hypothyroidism, specifically in the context of myxedema coma. It is characterized by peripheral neuropathy, which can present with weakness, numbness, and tingling in the extremities. While both Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and severe hypothyroidism can have neurological manifestations, myxedema neuropathy is not specific to T1DM. Therefore, having myxedema neuropathy does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM."
Neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus,4044391,True,"Yes, neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, both Type 1 and Type 2, and is caused by prolonged high blood sugar levels damaging the nerves. Since Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by hyperglycemia due to insulin deficiency, it can lead to neuropathy as a complication. Therefore, if a patient has neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Gastroparesis due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,37018728,False,"No

Rationale:
Gastroparesis is a condition that affects the normal movement of muscles in the stomach, leading to delayed emptying of food into the small intestine. While gastroparesis can be a complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the specific condition mentioned, ""Gastroparesis due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,"" indicates that it is specifically linked to type 2 diabetes. Since the malady in question is Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the presence of gastroparesis due to type 2 diabetes mellitus would not be specific to this malady. Therefore, the answer is no."
Diabetes mellitus,201820,True,"Yes, the condition ""Diabetes mellitus"" is specific to the malady ""Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."" This is because Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is a specific type of diabetes mellitus characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Therefore, if someone has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, they definitely have diabetes mellitus. However, if someone has diabetes mellitus, it does not necessarily mean they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, as there are other types of diabetes mellitus such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus."
Autonomic neuropathy due to endocrine disease,42537705,False,"No

Rationale: Autonomic neuropathy due to endocrine disease is a condition that can be seen in various endocrine disorders, including diabetes mellitus. While autonomic neuropathy can be a complication of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, it is not specific to this malady. It can also occur in other endocrine disorders such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, thyroid disorders, adrenal disorders, etc. Therefore, having autonomic neuropathy due to endocrine disease does not definitively mean that a person has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Type 2 diabetes mellitus,201826,False,"No, having Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is not specific to having Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). While both are forms of diabetes, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, whereas T1DM is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Therefore, having T2DM does not necessarily mean that a person has T1DM."
Congenital anomaly of face,439394,False,"No, a congenital anomaly of the face is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may have other health conditions or anomalies, a congenital anomaly of the face is not a defining characteristic or symptom of T1DM. It is important to consider the specific symptoms and diagnostic criteria for T1DM when assessing a potential diagnosis."
Absence of toe,4093531,False,"No, the condition ""Absence of toe"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The absence of a toe is a physical anomaly or injury that is not directly related to the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells seen in T1DM. While individuals with T1DM may experience complications such as peripheral neuropathy that could potentially lead to toe amputation in severe cases, the absence of a toe itself is not a defining characteristic or symptom of T1DM."
Pre-eclampsia,439393,False,"No, pre-eclampsia is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-related condition characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to other organ systems, most often the liver and kidneys. While pre-eclampsia can occur in women with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, it is not exclusive to this population. Pre-eclampsia can also occur in women without diabetes or with other types of diabetes. Therefore, having pre-eclampsia does not definitively mean that a person has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Diabetic ulcer of right wrist,3172958,False,"No

Rationale:
A diabetic ulcer of the right wrist is a specific manifestation of diabetes-related complications, such as peripheral neuropathy and poor wound healing, rather than a direct symptom or diagnostic criterion of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). While individuals with T1DM are at increased risk for developing diabetic ulcers due to the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on blood vessels and nerves, the presence of a diabetic ulcer on the right wrist does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM. Therefore, having a diabetic ulcer of the right wrist does not necessarily mean that an individual has T1DM."
Autonomic neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus,4175440,True,"Yes, autonomic neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Autonomic neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in individuals with longstanding and poorly controlled diabetes. Since Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition that can lead to various complications, including autonomic neuropathy, if a person has autonomic neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
High risk proliferative retinopathy without macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,4164174,True,"Yes

Rationale:
The condition described, high-risk proliferative retinopathy without macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, is a specific complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Proliferative retinopathy is a serious complication of diabetes that can lead to vision loss and blindness if left untreated. The presence of this condition in a patient indicates that they have diabetes mellitus, and the description specifies that it is due to diabetes mellitus. Therefore, if a patient has high-risk proliferative retinopathy without macular edema, they definitely have diabetes mellitus, specifically Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Diabetes mellitus in mother complicating childbirth,45757129,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Diabetes mellitus in mother complicating childbirth"" does not specifically indicate Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While it suggests that the mother has diabetes, it does not provide enough information to determine if it is specifically Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency, which is not explicitly mentioned in the condition provided. Therefore, having diabetes mellitus in the mother complicating childbirth does not definitively mean that the mother has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Neuropathic ulcer of foot due to diabetes mellitus,4065354,True,"Yes, the condition ""Neuropathic ulcer of foot due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Neuropathic ulcers are a common complication of diabetes, particularly in patients with longstanding uncontrolled hyperglycemia. In T1DM, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency, resulting in hyperglycemia. Chronic hyperglycemia can lead to nerve damage (neuropathy), particularly in the feet, which can result in neuropathic ulcers. 

Therefore, if a patient has a neuropathic ulcer of the foot due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This condition is specific to T1DM because it is a direct consequence of the metabolic abnormalities and complications associated with this particular type of diabetes."
Chronic multifocal osteomyelitis,4344376,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic multifocal osteomyelitis is a condition characterized by inflammation and infection of multiple bones, typically involving long bones and causing pain, swelling, and fever. This condition is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may be at a higher risk for infections due to their compromised immune system, the presence of chronic multifocal osteomyelitis does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM."
High risk proliferative retinopathy with clinically significant macula edema due to diabetes mellitus,4266042,True,"Yes, the condition of high risk proliferative retinopathy with clinically significant macula edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale: Proliferative retinopathy and macular edema are common complications of diabetes mellitus, particularly in individuals with longstanding and poorly controlled diabetes. In the case of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the chronic hyperglycemia and metabolic changes can lead to damage to the blood vessels in the retina, resulting in proliferative retinopathy. The presence of these specific retinal complications in the context of diabetes mellitus points towards Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus as the underlying cause."
Disease of non-coronary systemic artery,43022059,False,"No, the condition ""Disease of non-coronary systemic artery"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may develop complications such as cardiovascular disease, which can involve systemic arteries, the presence of a disease in a non-coronary systemic artery does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. There are many other potential causes for diseases of non-coronary systemic arteries, such as atherosclerosis, vasculitis, or other systemic conditions. Therefore, the condition is not specific to the malady."
Steroid-induced diabetes mellitus without complication,4099653,False,"No

Rationale:
Steroid-induced diabetes mellitus is a form of diabetes that occurs as a side effect of prolonged steroid use. While it shares some similarities with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) in terms of hyperglycemia, it is not specifically linked to the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells seen in T1DM. Therefore, having steroid-induced diabetes mellitus does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Type 2 diabetes mellitus with ulcer,4099651,False,"No

Rationale: The condition provided is Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with an ulcer, which is a specific type of diabetes characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. While individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus may develop ulcers as a complication of the disease, the presence of an ulcer is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, having Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with an ulcer does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Gestational diabetes mellitus in childbirth,45757124,False,"No

Rationale: Gestational diabetes mellitus is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While women with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus later in life, it is not a definitive indicator of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Gestational diabetes mellitus is a temporary condition that typically resolves after childbirth, whereas Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic autoimmune disorder."
Gangrenous disorder,439928,False,"No, gangrenous disorder is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Gangrene is a serious condition that occurs when body tissue dies due to a lack of blood flow or a bacterial infection. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, may be at a higher risk for developing gangrene due to complications such as poor circulation and nerve damage, gangrene can also occur in individuals without diabetes due to other underlying conditions or factors. Therefore, having gangrenous disorder does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Hyperglycemia due to diabetes mellitus,37311673,True,"Yes, hyperglycemia due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). In T1DM, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas leads to absolute insulin deficiency, resulting in hyperglycemia. Therefore, if someone has hyperglycemia due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have T1DM."
Essential hypertension,320128,False,"No, essential hypertension is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Essential hypertension is a common condition characterized by high blood pressure without a specific underlying cause. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may also have essential hypertension as a comorbidity, essential hypertension can occur in individuals without diabetes as well. Therefore, having essential hypertension does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Hypogonadism,4167354,False,"No, hypogonadism is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Hypogonadism refers to a condition in which the body doesn't produce enough sex hormones, which can lead to a variety of symptoms such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and infertility. While hypogonadism can occur in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having hypogonadism does not necessarily mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Acute tubular necrosis,444044,False,"No, acute tubular necrosis is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Acute tubular necrosis is a condition characterized by damage to the renal tubules in the kidneys, often caused by ischemia or nephrotoxic agents. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may develop kidney complications, including acute tubular necrosis, the presence of acute tubular necrosis does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It is important to consider other factors and diagnostic criteria when assessing for the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Erectile dysfunction,3655355,False,"No, erectile dysfunction is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While erectile dysfunction can be a complication of diabetes in general, it is not a defining symptom of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Erectile dysfunction can be caused by a variety of factors such as vascular disease, neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, and psychological issues. Therefore, having erectile dysfunction does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Arteriosclerotic gangrene,317577,False,"No, arteriosclerotic gangrene is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Arteriosclerotic gangrene refers to tissue death due to reduced blood flow caused by arteriosclerosis, which is a condition characterized by the hardening and narrowing of the arteries. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at an increased risk for developing arteriosclerosis and subsequent complications such as gangrene, arteriosclerotic gangrene can also occur in individuals without diabetes due to other underlying vascular conditions or risk factors. Therefore, the presence of arteriosclerotic gangrene does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Pre-existing hypertension in obstetric context,4311246,False,"No

Rationale: Pre-existing hypertension in an obstetric context is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may develop hypertension as a complication of the disease, pre-existing hypertension in an obstetric context can have various causes unrelated to T1DM, such as chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, having pre-existing hypertension in an obstetric context does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Traction retinal detachment involving macula,4338896,False,"No

Rationale: Traction retinal detachment involving the macula is a condition affecting the retina of the eye, specifically the macula, which is responsible for central vision. While diabetes can lead to various eye complications, including diabetic retinopathy, traction retinal detachment involving the macula is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It is more commonly associated with conditions such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy, trauma, or inflammatory conditions. Therefore, having traction retinal detachment involving the macula does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Combined traction and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment,4338897,False,"No

Rationale:
Combined traction and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is a condition specific to the eye, involving the detachment of the retina due to both tractional forces and a retinal break. This condition is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, as it is not directly related to the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells and insulin deficiency characteristic of T1DM. While individuals with T1DM may be at a higher risk for certain eye conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy, combined traction and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is not a defining feature of T1DM."
Disorder of soft tissue due to diabetes mellitus,4082346,True,"Yes, the condition ""Disorder of soft tissue due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Soft tissue disorders are common complications of diabetes mellitus, including T1DM. Diabetes can lead to damage of blood vessels and nerves, which can affect the soft tissues in the body. This can result in conditions such as diabetic foot ulcers, skin infections, and slow wound healing. Therefore, if someone has a disorder of soft tissue due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM, as this condition is a direct result of the metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes."
HELLP syndrome,4316372,False,"No

Rationale:
HELLP syndrome is a serious pregnancy complication that involves hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. It is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While a person with T1DM may develop complications during pregnancy, including preeclampsia or gestational diabetes, HELLP syndrome is a separate and distinct condition that is not directly related to T1DM."
Cataract due to diabetes mellitus,376979,True,"Yes, the condition ""Cataract due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Cataracts are a common complication of diabetes, particularly in individuals with poorly controlled blood sugar levels over a long period of time. The chronic hyperglycemia in T1DM can lead to the development of cataracts, which are characterized by clouding of the lens in the eye. Therefore, if a person has cataracts due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM."
Traction detachment of retina due to diabetes mellitus,4338901,True,"Yes, the condition of traction detachment of retina due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

In T1DM, chronic hyperglycemia can lead to microvascular complications, including diabetic retinopathy. Traction detachment of the retina is a complication of diabetic retinopathy where abnormal blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina and can cause the retina to detach. This condition is directly related to the underlying diabetes mellitus, specifically T1DM, due to the chronic hyperglycemia and microvascular damage associated with the disease. Therefore, if a patient has traction detachment of the retina due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have T1DM."
Polyneuropathy due to secondary diabetes mellitus,760979,False,"No.

Rationale: Polyneuropathy due to secondary diabetes mellitus suggests that the neuropathy is a result of another underlying cause of diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus or a secondary cause of hyperglycemia. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is specifically characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leading to absolute insulin deficiency, which is not a secondary cause of hyperglycemia. Therefore, having polyneuropathy due to secondary diabetes mellitus does not necessarily mean that the individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Prolapse of cord,440476,False,"No, prolapse of cord is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Prolapse of cord refers to the umbilical cord slipping through the cervix before the baby during delivery, which can lead to compression of the cord and compromise blood flow to the baby. This is a complication during childbirth and is not directly related to the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells seen in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Diabetic mononeuropathy,4048028,True,"Yes, diabetic mononeuropathy is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Diabetic mononeuropathy is a type of diabetic neuropathy that affects a single nerve, leading to symptoms such as pain, weakness, or numbness in a specific area of the body. It is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in individuals with poorly controlled blood sugar levels. Since Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition that can lead to various complications, including diabetic neuropathy, if a person has diabetic mononeuropathy, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Retinal edema,372903,False,"No

Rationale: Retinal edema is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While retinal edema can be a complication of diabetes, it is not exclusive to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and can occur in other conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, or retinal vein occlusion. Therefore, having retinal edema does not definitively mean that a person has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Dyslipidemia,4159131,False,"No

Rationale: Dyslipidemia, which refers to abnormal levels of lipids (cholesterol and/or triglycerides) in the blood, is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). While individuals with T1DM may have dyslipidemia as a comorbidity, dyslipidemia can also occur in individuals without T1DM due to various other factors such as diet, genetics, and lifestyle choices. Therefore, having dyslipidemia does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Vitreous hemorrhage due to diabetes mellitus,4195045,True,"Yes, vitreous hemorrhage due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Vitreous hemorrhage is a complication of diabetes mellitus that can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. However, in the context of this task, since we are specifically looking at Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the presence of vitreous hemorrhage due to diabetes mellitus would indicate the presence of this particular malady. This is because vitreous hemorrhage is a complication that can arise from the long-term effects of uncontrolled diabetes, which is a hallmark of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, if a patient has vitreous hemorrhage due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Necrosis of amputation stump,4308713,False,"No

Rationale: Necrosis of an amputation stump is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may be at higher risk for complications such as poor wound healing and infection, necrosis of an amputation stump can occur in individuals with various underlying conditions or factors such as peripheral vascular disease, infection, or inadequate blood supply to the area. Therefore, the presence of necrosis of an amputation stump does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM."
Hypoglycemic coma due to diabetes mellitus,4226798,True,"Yes, the condition ""Hypoglycemic coma due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

In T1DM, individuals are at risk of hypoglycemia due to the use of insulin therapy to manage their condition. Hypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels drop too low, leading to symptoms such as confusion, dizziness, sweating, and in severe cases, coma. 

Therefore, if someone experiences a hypoglycemic coma due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM, as this complication is commonly associated with this specific type of diabetes. Additionally, the description of T1DM mentions the need for lifelong insulin replacement therapy, which can increase the risk of hypoglycemia and subsequent coma if not managed properly."
Acute osteomyelitis of ankle and/or foot,135350,False,"No, acute osteomyelitis of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Acute osteomyelitis is a bacterial infection of the bone, which can occur in individuals with or without diabetes. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, may be at a higher risk for infections due to compromised immune function, the presence of acute osteomyelitis in the ankle and/or foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Additional diagnostic tests and evaluation would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in this case."
Hypoglycemic coma due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,36714116,False,"No, hypoglycemic coma due to type 2 diabetes mellitus is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Hypoglycemic coma is a severe complication of diabetes where blood sugar levels drop dangerously low, leading to loss of consciousness. While hypoglycemia can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, it is more commonly associated with Type 1 Diabetes due to the reliance on insulin therapy. However, hypoglycemic coma can also occur in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, especially in cases where individuals are on insulin or certain medications that can lower blood sugar levels too much.

Therefore, the presence of hypoglycemic coma due to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It is important to consider other factors such as the individual's medical history, treatment regimen, and diagnostic tests to accurately determine the underlying cause of the hypoglycemic coma."
Microalbuminuria,4195061,True,"Yes, microalbuminuria is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).

Rationale:
Microalbuminuria is a condition characterized by the presence of small amounts of albumin in the urine, which is an early sign of kidney damage. In the case of T1DM, microalbuminuria is a common complication due to the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on the kidneys. Therefore, if a patient with T1DM has microalbuminuria, it is highly likely that the condition is specific to T1DM. However, it is important to note that not all patients with T1DM will develop microalbuminuria, but if it is present, it is strongly associated with the malady."
Non-high-risk proliferative retinopathy with no macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,4161671,True,"Yes, the condition of non-high-risk proliferative retinopathy with no macular edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Proliferative retinopathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus, and it specifically occurs in individuals with longstanding diabetes, such as those with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The presence of retinopathy in this case indicates a long duration of diabetes and poor glycemic control, which are common features of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Additionally, the absence of macular edema in this condition further supports the likelihood of it being associated with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, as macular edema is a common complication seen in individuals with diabetes. Therefore, if an individual has non-high-risk proliferative retinopathy with no macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Secondary diabetes mellitus,195771,False,"No, secondary diabetes mellitus is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Secondary diabetes mellitus refers to diabetes that is a result of another underlying condition or factor, such as pancreatitis, certain medications, or hormonal disorders. While Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is a specific type of diabetes characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, secondary diabetes mellitus can be caused by a variety of different factors unrelated to autoimmune destruction. Therefore, having secondary diabetes mellitus does not necessarily mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Ulcer of lower extremity,197304,False,"No, an ulcer of the lower extremity is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may be at higher risk for developing ulcers due to complications such as neuropathy and poor circulation, the presence of an ulcer of the lower extremity does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM. Ulcers can have various causes such as vascular disease, trauma, infection, or other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, the condition of an ulcer of the lower extremity is not specific to T1DM."
"Diabetes mellitus during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium",4058243,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition ""Diabetes mellitus during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium"" refers to gestational diabetes, which is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and typically resolves after childbirth. It is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), as T1DM is a chronic autoimmune disorder that is not limited to pregnancy and childbirth. While women with T1DM may also develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy, having gestational diabetes does not necessarily mean that a person has T1DM. Therefore, the condition is not specific to the malady of T1DM."
Retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus,4174977,True,"Yes, retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale: Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, both Type 1 and Type 2. However, in the context of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, retinopathy is a well-known complication that can occur due to the chronic hyperglycemia associated with the disease. Therefore, if a patient has retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Sepsis,132797,False,"No

Rationale: Sepsis is a severe condition caused by the body's response to an infection, leading to widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction. While sepsis can occur in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) due to their increased susceptibility to infections, having sepsis does not necessarily mean that an individual has T1DM. Sepsis is a complication that can occur in various medical conditions, not just T1DM."
"Maternal obesity complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, antepartum",42872398,False,"No, maternal obesity complicating pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium, antepartum is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). While maternal obesity can be a risk factor for developing gestational diabetes, which is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy, it is not a defining characteristic of T1DM. T1DM is specifically characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency, which is not directly related to maternal obesity. Therefore, having maternal obesity complicating pregnancy does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Poorly controlled type I diabetes with renal complication,3192052,True,"Yes, the condition of poorly controlled type I diabetes with renal complication is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

The description of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus includes complications such as nephropathy, which refers to kidney damage as a result of diabetes. Therefore, if a patient has poorly controlled Type 1 diabetes with renal complications, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The renal complication further supports the diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in this case."
Proliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus,380096,True,"Yes, proliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale: Proliferative retinopathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus, and specifically, it is more commonly associated with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.

Therefore, if a patient has proliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Dysmorphism,4080891,False,"No, dysmorphism is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Dysmorphism refers to abnormal facial features or body proportions that are typically associated with genetic disorders or syndromes. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may have dysmorphic features as part of a genetic syndrome or as a result of complications from the disease, dysmorphism itself is not a defining characteristic of T1DM."
Mixed acid-base balance disorder,441536,False,"No

Rationale:
A mixed acid-base balance disorder is a general term that encompasses a variety of conditions involving disturbances in the body's acid-base balance, such as metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may develop metabolic acidosis, it is not specific to this condition. Therefore, the presence of a mixed acid-base balance disorder does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Acute renal failure syndrome,197320,False,"No

Rationale: Acute renal failure syndrome is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may develop acute renal failure as a complication of the disease, acute renal failure can also occur due to various other causes such as dehydration, medication toxicity, urinary tract obstruction, or severe infection. Therefore, having acute renal failure syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Chronic kidney disease stage 3,443597,False,"No, chronic kidney disease stage 3 is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease due to the effects of prolonged hyperglycemia on the kidneys, chronic kidney disease stage 3 can have various causes such as hypertension, glomerulonephritis, or other systemic diseases. Therefore, having chronic kidney disease stage 3 does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Nephrotic syndrome due to diabetes mellitus,4027121,True,"Yes, nephrotic syndrome due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Nephrotic syndrome is a kidney disorder characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia. In the context of diabetes mellitus, nephrotic syndrome can be a complication of long-standing uncontrolled diabetes, particularly in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The chronic hyperglycemia and associated microvascular complications in T1DM can lead to diabetic nephropathy, which can progress to nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, if a patient has nephrotic syndrome due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Severe nonproliferative retinopathy without macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,4266637,True,"Yes, the condition of severe nonproliferative retinopathy without macular edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). This is because retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, and the description specifies that it is due to diabetes mellitus. In T1DM, the chronic hyperglycemia can lead to damage in the blood vessels of the retina, resulting in retinopathy. Therefore, if a person has severe nonproliferative retinopathy without macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM."
Osteomyelitis due to type 1 diabetes mellitus,45769834,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteomyelitis is a bone infection that can occur in individuals with diabetes, but it is not specific to type 1 diabetes mellitus. Osteomyelitis can occur in individuals with other types of diabetes, as well as in individuals without diabetes. Therefore, having osteomyelitis does not definitively mean that an individual has type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Severe malnutrition due to type 1 diabetes mellitus,45769833,False,"No.

Rationale:
Severe malnutrition is not a specific condition that is directly linked to type 1 diabetes mellitus. While individuals with type 1 diabetes may experience weight loss as a symptom of the disease, severe malnutrition is not a defining characteristic of type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is more likely that severe malnutrition in this case is a result of inadequate dietary intake or other underlying factors unrelated to type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Sensory neuropathy,4318869,False,"No

Rationale: Sensory neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). However, sensory neuropathy is not specific to T1DM as it can also occur in other conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, and certain infections. Therefore, having sensory neuropathy does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Moderate nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus,377552,True,"Yes, the condition of moderate nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale: Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, and the presence of retinopathy in this case specifically mentions it is due to diabetes mellitus. Since Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is a known cause of retinopathy, if a patient has moderate nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."

Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency, whereas type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Therefore, the presence of severe nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus type 2 would not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Anemia in chronic kidney disease,45768812,False,"No

Rationale: Anemia in chronic kidney disease is a common complication of kidney dysfunction, where the kidneys are unable to produce enough erythropoietin to stimulate red blood cell production. While anemia can be a complication of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) due to various factors such as kidney damage from long-term high blood sugar levels, having anemia in chronic kidney disease does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM. Anemia in chronic kidney disease can have multiple causes, including other underlying conditions such as chronic kidney disease itself, iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, or other chronic diseases. Therefore, the presence of anemia in chronic kidney disease does not specifically indicate the presence of T1DM."
Chronic kidney disease stage 2,443601,False,"No

Rationale:
Chronic kidney disease stage 2 is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM are at an increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease due to the long-term effects of uncontrolled hyperglycemia, chronic kidney disease can have various causes such as hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and other systemic diseases. Therefore, having chronic kidney disease stage 2 does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Chronic kidney disease stage 1,443614,False,"No, chronic kidney disease stage 1 is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at an increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease, having chronic kidney disease stage 1 does not definitively mean that a person has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Chronic kidney disease can have various causes, including hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and other conditions unrelated to diabetes. Therefore, the presence of chronic kidney disease stage 1 does not necessarily indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Chronic kidney disease stage 4,443612,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic kidney disease stage 4 is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may develop chronic kidney disease as a complication of their diabetes, chronic kidney disease stage 4 can have various causes such as hypertension, glomerulonephritis, or other systemic diseases. Therefore, having chronic kidney disease stage 4 does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Eating disorder,439002,False,"No

Rationale: While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) may develop an eating disorder, having an eating disorder is not specific to T1DM. Eating disorders are a separate medical condition characterized by abnormal eating habits that may involve either insufficient or excessive food intake. While there may be a correlation between T1DM and eating disorders, the presence of an eating disorder does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM."
Cystoid macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,3655914,True,"Yes, cystoid macular edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Cystoid macular edema is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly in patients with longstanding and poorly controlled diabetes. It is a result of fluid accumulation in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the chronic hyperglycemia and associated microvascular changes can lead to damage to the blood vessels in the retina, resulting in macular edema.

Therefore, if a patient has cystoid macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. However, not all patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus will develop cystoid macular edema, as it is a complication that may or may not occur in the course of the disease."
Chronic kidney disease stage 5,443611,True,"Yes, chronic kidney disease stage 5 can be specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in individuals with poorly controlled blood glucose levels over an extended period of time. In the case of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency, which can result in uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Prolonged hyperglycemia can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to CKD. 

Therefore, if an individual with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus develops chronic kidney disease stage 5, it is highly likely that the kidney disease is a direct consequence of the diabetes. However, it is important to note that not all individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus will develop CKD, as the risk factors and progression of complications can vary among patients."
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy,4311708,True,"Yes, diabetic peripheral neuropathy is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It is a type of nerve damage that can occur as a result of prolonged high blood sugar levels. Therefore, if a person has diabetic peripheral neuropathy, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. However, not all individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus will develop diabetic peripheral neuropathy."
Severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with venous beading,3655913,True,"Yes, the condition of severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with venous beading is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in individuals with longstanding or poorly controlled diabetes. The presence of severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with venous beading indicates advanced damage to the blood vessels in the retina, which is a hallmark complication of diabetes. Since T1DM is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and can lead to microvascular complications such as diabetic retinopathy, the presence of this specific retinal condition strongly suggests the individual has T1DM."
Osteomyelitis of ankle AND/OR foot,133853,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteomyelitis of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, are at an increased risk for developing infections such as osteomyelitis due to impaired immune function and poor circulation, the presence of osteomyelitis in the ankle and/or foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Osteomyelitis can occur in individuals without diabetes as well. Therefore, the condition of osteomyelitis of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Ulcer of left foot due to diabetes mellitus,3655383,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Ulcer of left foot due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Ulcers on the feet are a common complication of diabetes, particularly in individuals with poorly controlled blood sugar levels. The presence of an ulcer on the foot in a patient with diabetes is a strong indicator of the disease, as it is often a result of diabetic neuropathy and poor circulation associated with diabetes. Additionally, the description specifies that the ulcer is due to diabetes mellitus, further linking it to the underlying condition.

Therefore, if a patient has an ulcer on their left foot due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Ulcer of right foot due to diabetes mellitus,3655382,True,"Yes, the condition ""Ulcer of right foot due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Ulcers on the feet are a common complication of diabetes, particularly in patients with longstanding uncontrolled hyperglycemia. The presence of an ulcer on the foot due to diabetes mellitus is a clear indication of the disease process affecting the individual. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency, which can result in complications such as foot ulcers due to poor wound healing and neuropathy. Therefore, if a patient has an ulcer on their foot due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Hyperlipidemia,432867,False,"No, hyperlipidemia is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). While individuals with T1DM may have hyperlipidemia as a comorbidity, hyperlipidemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids (cholesterol and/or triglycerides) in the blood. It is not a defining feature of T1DM and can be present in individuals without T1DM as well. Therefore, having hyperlipidemia does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Mixed maculopathy due to diabetes mellitus,4195498,True,"Yes, the condition ""Mixed maculopathy due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Maculopathy refers to any pathological condition affecting the macula, which is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. In diabetes mellitus, maculopathy can occur as a complication of the disease, leading to vision impairment. 

Since the condition specifically mentions ""due to diabetes mellitus,"" it indicates that the maculopathy is a direct result of diabetes. In the case of T1DM, the chronic hyperglycemia and metabolic changes can lead to microvascular complications, including diabetic retinopathy, which can manifest as maculopathy. 

Therefore, if an individual has mixed maculopathy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Chronic kidney disease,46271022,False,"No

Rationale:
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). While CKD can be a complication of T1DM due to the long-term effects of uncontrolled high blood sugar levels on the kidneys, CKD can also have various other causes such as hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and polycystic kidney disease. Therefore, having CKD does not definitively mean that a person has T1DM, as CKD can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions."
Skin ulcer due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,36712670,False,"No

Rationale: The condition specified is a skin ulcer due to type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is specifically associated with type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, as described, is characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Skin ulcers are more commonly associated with type 2 diabetes due to factors such as peripheral neuropathy and poor circulation. While individuals with type 1 diabetes can also develop skin ulcers, it is not a specific condition that would definitively indicate the presence of type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Gangrene of right lower limb due to atherosclerosis,36717279,False,"No

Rationale: Gangrene of the right lower limb due to atherosclerosis is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1, are at an increased risk for atherosclerosis and subsequent complications such as gangrene, the presence of gangrene due to atherosclerosis does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Other conditions such as peripheral artery disease can also lead to gangrene in the lower limbs."
Nephrotic syndrome,195314,False,"No

Rationale: Nephrotic syndrome is a kidney disorder characterized by the presence of protein in the urine, low protein levels in the blood, high cholesterol levels, and swelling (edema). While nephrotic syndrome can be a complication of diabetes, it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Nephrotic syndrome can also be caused by other conditions such as membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Therefore, having nephrotic syndrome does not definitively mean that a person has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
End-stage renal disease,193782,False,"No

Rationale:
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). While ESRD can be a complication of T1DM due to diabetic nephropathy, it can also be caused by other conditions such as hypertension, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and other primary renal diseases. Therefore, having ESRD does not definitively mean that a person has T1DM."
Autonomic neuropathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,37016768,False,"No

Rationale: Autonomic neuropathy is a complication commonly associated with diabetes mellitus, but it is more commonly seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus rather than type 1 diabetes mellitus. While it is possible for individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus to develop autonomic neuropathy, it is not specific to this malady. Autonomic neuropathy can also occur in other conditions or as a result of other factors such as alcoholism, autoimmune diseases, or certain medications. Therefore, the presence of autonomic neuropathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus does not definitively indicate the presence of type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Proteinuric nephropathy due to diabetes mellitus,4030664,True,"Yes, proteinuric nephropathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Proteinuric nephropathy is a condition characterized by the presence of protein in the urine, which is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the chronic hyperglycemia and metabolic changes can lead to damage to the kidneys, resulting in proteinuria. Therefore, if a patient has proteinuric nephropathy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Ulcer of heel due to diabetes mellitus,37312207,True,"Yes, the condition ""Ulcer of heel due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale: Ulcers on the heel are a common complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly in patients with poor glycemic control. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency, which can result in complications such as foot ulcers due to poor wound healing and peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, if a patient has an ulcer on the heel due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Focal exudative maculopathy due to diabetes mellitus,4210872,True,"Yes, focal exudative maculopathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Focal exudative maculopathy is a complication of diabetes that can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In T1DM, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells leads to hyperglycemia, which can cause damage to blood vessels in the retina, leading to diabetic retinopathy. Focal exudative maculopathy is a specific type of diabetic retinopathy that can occur in individuals with T1DM. Therefore, if a person has focal exudative maculopathy due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have T1DM."
Chronic disease of genitourinary system,4134595,False,"No, the condition ""Chronic disease of genitourinary system"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may develop complications affecting the genitourinary system such as diabetic nephropathy or urinary tract infections, the presence of a chronic disease in the genitourinary system does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It is important to consider other factors and diagnostic criteria specific to diabetes when assessing for the presence of T1DM."
Hyperosmolar coma due to diabetes mellitus,4226238,True,"Yes, hyperosmolar coma due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Hyperosmolar coma is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by severe hyperglycemia, dehydration, and altered mental status. This condition is more commonly associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) due to the presence of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. However, in the context of T1DM, if a patient experiences hyperosmolar coma, it is likely due to a severe lack of insulin leading to extremely high blood glucose levels. Therefore, if a patient with T1DM develops hyperosmolar coma, it is a clear indication of the malady."
Brittle diabetes mellitus,4019513,True,"Yes, brittle diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Brittle diabetes mellitus is a term used to describe a subset of individuals with diabetes, particularly Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, who experience extreme fluctuations in blood glucose levels that are difficult to control. These individuals often have frequent episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, leading to unstable blood sugar levels. 

Since brittle diabetes mellitus is a severe form of diabetes characterized by extreme glycemic variability, it is more commonly seen in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus due to the absolute insulin deficiency resulting from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Therefore, if someone has brittle diabetes mellitus, they definitely have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Disorder of nervous system due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,376065,False,"No. The condition ""Disorder of nervous system due to type 2 diabetes mellitus"" is specific to type 2 diabetes mellitus, not type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency, whereas type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Therefore, a disorder of the nervous system due to type 2 diabetes mellitus would not be specific to type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Gastroparesis syndrome,195847,False,"No

Rationale: Gastroparesis syndrome is a condition characterized by delayed gastric emptying, resulting in symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, and early satiety. While gastroparesis can be a complication of poorly controlled diabetes, it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, having gastroparesis syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Ketoacidotic coma due to diabetes mellitus,4095288,True,"Yes, the condition ""Ketoacidotic coma due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

A ketoacidotic coma is a severe complication of diabetes mellitus, specifically more common in individuals with T1DM. It occurs when there is a lack of insulin in the body, leading to the breakdown of fats for energy, resulting in the production of ketones and the development of ketoacidosis. This condition is a direct consequence of the absolute insulin deficiency seen in T1DM, making it specific to this malady. Additionally, the description of T1DM mentions diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as a potential complication, further supporting the association between T1DM and a ketoacidotic coma."
Hypoglycemia due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,45757363,False,"No.

Rationale:
Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by low blood sugar levels, which is the opposite of hyperglycemia seen in diabetes. Hypoglycemia due to type 2 diabetes mellitus would not be specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus as they are two distinct types of diabetes with different underlying causes. Type 2 diabetes is typically characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, whereas Type 1 diabetes is characterized by absolute insulin deficiency due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Therefore, hypoglycemia due to type 2 diabetes mellitus would not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Lack of awareness,4247372,False,"No, lack of awareness is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Lack of awareness can be a symptom of various medical conditions or even non-medical issues such as stress, fatigue, or lack of sleep. In the context of T1DM, lack of awareness may refer to unawareness of hypoglycemia, a common complication of diabetes where blood sugar levels drop dangerously low. However, lack of awareness alone is not a definitive indicator of T1DM as it can be present in other conditions as well."
Chronic osteomyelitis of ankle and/or foot with draining sinus,46271951,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic osteomyelitis of the ankle and/or foot with a draining sinus is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, are at an increased risk for infections, chronic osteomyelitis with a draining sinus can occur in individuals without diabetes as well. Therefore, having chronic osteomyelitis with a draining sinus does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Sensory neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus,4131117,True,"Yes, sensory neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Sensory neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in patients with longstanding hyperglycemia. It is characterized by damage to the nerves that transmit sensory information, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and pain in the extremities. Since Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition that can lead to various complications, including sensory neuropathy, having this condition would indicate the presence of the malady."
Moderate nonproliferative retinopathy due to secondary diabetes mellitus,37016358,True,"Yes, the condition of moderate nonproliferative retinopathy due to secondary diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, and it can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. However, the presence of retinopathy due to secondary diabetes mellitus indicates that the diabetes is not the primary cause of the retinopathy. In this case, the retinopathy is a secondary complication of another underlying condition that is causing the diabetes. Since T1DM is the primary cause of the retinopathy in this scenario, the condition is specific to T1DM."
Disorder of amputation stump,4345680,False,"No, a disorder of an amputation stump is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may undergo amputations due to complications such as peripheral neuropathy and poor wound healing, a disorder of an amputation stump can occur in individuals without T1DM as well. It is not a defining characteristic of T1DM and can be seen in various other medical conditions or situations."
Clinically significant macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,35626764,True,"Yes, clinically significant macular edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Macular edema is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in patients with longstanding uncontrolled hyperglycemia. In T1DM, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency, resulting in hyperglycemia which can cause damage to the blood vessels in the retina, leading to macular edema. Therefore, if a patient has clinically significant macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have T1DM."
Erectile dysfunction due to diabetes mellitus,35626763,True,"Yes, erectile dysfunction due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Erectile dysfunction is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, both Type 1 and Type 2. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the chronic hyperglycemia and vascular damage can lead to nerve damage and impaired blood flow, which can contribute to erectile dysfunction. Therefore, if a person has erectile dysfunction due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Disorder of kidney due to diabetes mellitus,192279,True,"Yes, the condition ""Disorder of kidney due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Patients with T1DM are at an increased risk of developing kidney complications, known as diabetic nephropathy, due to the chronic hyperglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities associated with the disease. Over time, uncontrolled diabetes can damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to kidney dysfunction and ultimately kidney failure. Therefore, if a patient has a disorder of the kidney due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM."
Hypoglycemic coma,380688,False,"No, hypoglycemic coma is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). While hypoglycemic coma can occur in individuals with T1DM due to low blood sugar levels resulting from insulin therapy, it is not exclusive to this condition. Hypoglycemic coma can also occur in individuals with other types of diabetes, such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, as well as in individuals without diabetes who experience severe drops in blood sugar levels. Therefore, the presence of hypoglycemic coma does not definitively indicate T1DM."
Cranial nerve palsy due to diabetes mellitus,35626762,True,"Yes, cranial nerve palsy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Cranial nerve palsy can be a complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly in cases of longstanding uncontrolled hyperglycemia. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency, which can result in complications such as cranial nerve palsy. Therefore, if a patient presents with cranial nerve palsy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Infection of amputation stump,4176170,False,"No

Rationale:
An infection of an amputation stump is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1, may be at a higher risk for infections due to compromised immune function and poor wound healing, an infection of an amputation stump can occur in individuals without diabetes as well. Therefore, having an infection of an amputation stump does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Diabetes mellitus in remission,45766050,False,"No, the condition ""Diabetes mellitus in remission"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Diabetes mellitus in remission refers to a state where a person's blood sugar levels are within a normal range without the need for medication or insulin. This can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. 

In the case of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, achieving remission is rare and typically not a long-term outcome due to the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Therefore, if a person with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is in remission, it may be temporary and not indicative of the absence of the disease. 

In summary, while Diabetes mellitus in remission can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Peripheral vascular disorder due to diabetes mellitus,321822,True,"Yes, the condition ""Peripheral vascular disorder due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Peripheral vascular disorder, also known as peripheral vascular disease (PVD), is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly in individuals with longstanding and poorly controlled diabetes. The chronic hyperglycemia and associated vascular changes in diabetes can lead to damage to blood vessels, including those in the peripheral vascular system. This can result in reduced blood flow to the extremities, leading to symptoms such as leg pain, cramping, numbness, and non-healing wounds.

Given that T1DM is a systemic disease that affects multiple organ systems, including the vascular system, individuals with T1DM are at increased risk for developing peripheral vascular disorder. Therefore, if someone has peripheral vascular disorder specifically due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM."
Drug-induced hypoglycemia without coma,4096804,False,"No

Rationale: Drug-induced hypoglycemia without coma is a condition that can occur in individuals taking medications that lower blood sugar levels, such as insulin or certain oral hypoglycemic agents. While hypoglycemia can be a complication of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) due to insulin therapy, it is not specific to T1DM. Therefore, individuals with drug-induced hypoglycemia without coma may or may not have T1DM."
Ketoacidotic coma due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,4228443,False,"No

Rationale: A ketoacidotic coma is a severe complication of diabetes characterized by high levels of ketones in the blood, leading to acidosis. While ketoacidosis can occur in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, it is more commonly associated with type 1 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, ketoacidosis is less common and usually occurs in the setting of other factors such as infection or stress. Therefore, the presence of a ketoacidotic coma due to type 2 diabetes mellitus does not definitively indicate the presence of type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Retinal ischemia,378142,False,"No, retinal ischemia is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Retinal ischemia refers to a condition where there is inadequate blood flow to the retina, leading to decreased oxygen supply and potential damage to the retinal tissue. While retinal ischemia can be a complication of diabetes, it is not exclusive to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It can also occur in other conditions such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and retinal artery occlusion. Therefore, having retinal ischemia does not definitively mean that a person has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Ankle ulcer,4171556,False,"No, an ankle ulcer is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, are at an increased risk for developing ulcers due to factors such as neuropathy and impaired wound healing, an ankle ulcer can have various causes such as trauma, infection, poor circulation, or other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, the presence of an ankle ulcer does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Pre-eclampsia or eclampsia with pre-existing hypertension,141084,False,"No

Rationale: Pre-eclampsia or eclampsia with pre-existing hypertension is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may develop pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, the presence of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia with pre-existing hypertension does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM. These conditions are separate entities with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. It is important to consider each condition individually and not assume a direct correlation between them."
Rubeosis iridis,440098,False,"No, rubeosis iridis is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Rubeosis iridis, also known as neovascularization of the iris, is a condition characterized by the growth of abnormal blood vessels on the iris. While rubeosis iridis can be associated with diabetes, it is not exclusive to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It can also be seen in other conditions such as central retinal vein occlusion, ocular ischemic syndrome, and ocular tumors. Therefore, the presence of rubeosis iridis does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Hyperglycemia due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,37016349,False,"No, hyperglycemia due to type 2 diabetes mellitus is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While both conditions involve elevated blood glucose levels, they have different underlying causes. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, whereas Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Therefore, having hyperglycemia due to type 2 diabetes mellitus does not definitively mean that a person has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Chronic ulcer of skin,134441,False,"No

Rationale:
A chronic ulcer of the skin is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1, are at an increased risk of developing chronic ulcers due to factors such as poor circulation and nerve damage, the presence of a chronic skin ulcer alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Other conditions and factors can also lead to the development of chronic skin ulcers."
Bilateral atherosclerosis of lower limbs with gangrene,35615028,False,"No.

Rationale:
Bilateral atherosclerosis of lower limbs with gangrene is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM are at an increased risk for developing atherosclerosis and subsequent complications such as gangrene, this condition can also occur in individuals without T1DM. Atherosclerosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries, leading to reduced blood flow, and can be caused by various factors such as smoking, high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes (both type 1 and type 2). Therefore, the presence of bilateral atherosclerosis of lower limbs with gangrene does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM."
Peripheral nerve disease,4117779,False,"No

Rationale: Peripheral nerve disease is a general term that refers to any condition affecting the peripheral nerves, which are the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. While peripheral nerve disease can be a complication of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), it is not specific to T1DM. There are many other potential causes of peripheral nerve disease, such as other types of diabetes, autoimmune disorders, infections, and vitamin deficiencies. Therefore, having peripheral nerve disease does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Hyperosmolarity,4032787,False,"No, hyperosmolarity is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Hyperosmolarity refers to an increased concentration of osmotically active particles in the blood, leading to dehydration and potential complications. While hyperosmolarity can occur in T1DM as a result of uncontrolled hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, it is not exclusive to this condition. Hyperosmolarity can also be seen in other medical conditions such as hypernatremia, dehydration, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), and certain medication side effects. Therefore, the presence of hyperosmolarity alone does not definitively indicate T1DM."
Complication associated with insulin pump,43021246,False,"No

Rationale: A complication associated with an insulin pump is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may use insulin pumps as part of their treatment regimen, complications with the pump can occur in individuals with other types of diabetes or even in individuals without diabetes who may be using the pump for other medical conditions. Therefore, having a complication associated with an insulin pump does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Secondary combined hyperlipidemia,4079887,False,"No

Rationale:
Secondary combined hyperlipidemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, which can be caused by various factors such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, renal disease, and certain medications. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) may develop secondary combined hyperlipidemia as a complication of their diabetes, not all individuals with secondary combined hyperlipidemia have T1DM. Therefore, having secondary combined hyperlipidemia does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Myasthenic syndrome due to hypothyroidism,4101898,False,"No

Rationale:
Myasthenic syndrome due to hypothyroidism is a condition where muscle weakness and fatigue are caused by hypothyroidism, a deficiency of thyroid hormone. While hypothyroidism can cause muscle weakness, it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, having myasthenic syndrome due to hypothyroidism does not necessarily mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Polyneuropathy due to diabetes mellitus,376112,True,"Yes, polyneuropathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Polyneuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, and it can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. However, in the case of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas leads to absolute insulin deficiency, which can result in more severe and rapid development of complications such as polyneuropathy. Therefore, if a patient has polyneuropathy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Nonproliferative retinopathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,43530656,False,"No

Rationale: Nonproliferative retinopathy is a complication commonly associated with diabetes, but specifically with type 2 diabetes mellitus, not type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes is more commonly associated with diabetic ketoacidosis and autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. While retinopathy can occur in both types of diabetes, the specific condition of nonproliferative retinopathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus would not be specific to type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Hyperosmolar coma due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,201530,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition described, hyperosmolar coma due to type 2 diabetes mellitus, specifically mentions type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is a different form of diabetes than type 1 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, this condition is not specific to the malady of type 1 diabetes mellitus. While both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can lead to hyperosmolar coma, the specific mention of type 2 diabetes in the condition means that it is not exclusive to type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Neuropathy associated with hypoglycemia,4101895,False,"No

Rationale: Neuropathy associated with hypoglycemia is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While neuropathy can be a complication of diabetes, it is not exclusive to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and can also occur in other types of diabetes, as well as in individuals without diabetes. Therefore, having neuropathy associated with hypoglycemia does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Acidosis,435517,False,"No, acidosis is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Acidosis can occur in various medical conditions, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a complication of T1DM. However, acidosis can also be caused by other conditions such as kidney failure, severe infections, certain medications, and other metabolic disorders. Therefore, while acidosis can be a symptom of T1DM, it is not specific to this malady as it can be present in other medical conditions as well."
Persistent macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,3655948,True,"Yes, persistent macular edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Macular edema is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in patients with longstanding uncontrolled hyperglycemia. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the chronic hyperglycemia can lead to damage to the blood vessels in the retina, resulting in macular edema. Therefore, if a patient has persistent macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Type 1 diabetes mellitus well controlled,40484649,False,"No

Rationale:
Having well-controlled Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus implies that the individual already has the malady of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, if someone has the condition of ""Type 1 diabetes mellitus well controlled,"" they definitely have the malady of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Mild nonproliferative retinopathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,45757435,False,"No.

Rationale: The condition described, mild nonproliferative retinopathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus, specifically mentions type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is a different type of diabetes than type 1 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, this condition is not specific to the malady of type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus,4191611,True,"Yes, lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale: Lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy is a neurological complication that can occur in individuals with diabetes mellitus, particularly in those with longstanding and poorly controlled diabetes. It is characterized by severe pain, weakness, and sensory loss in the lower extremities. Since this condition specifically mentions ""due to diabetes mellitus,"" it indicates a direct association with diabetes. Given that the malady in question is Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, which is known to cause various complications including neuropathy, it is reasonable to conclude that lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Compressive optic neuropathy due to thyroid eye disease,4220165,False,"No

Rationale:
Compressive optic neuropathy due to thyroid eye disease is a specific condition that can occur in individuals with thyroid eye disease, which is an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid gland and the tissues around the eyes. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may experience various complications, including eye-related issues such as diabetic retinopathy, compressive optic neuropathy due to thyroid eye disease is not a direct symptom or complication of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, having compressive optic neuropathy due to thyroid eye disease does not necessarily mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Very severe nonproliferative retinopathy with clinically significant macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,4290823,True,"Yes, the condition of very severe nonproliferative retinopathy with clinically significant macular edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale: Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, and the presence of very severe nonproliferative retinopathy with clinically significant macular edema is a specific complication associated with diabetes mellitus. Since the condition specifically mentions diabetes mellitus as the cause, it is highly likely that the individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, as this malady is known to be associated with the development of diabetic retinopathy."
Severe nonproliferative retinopathy with clinically significant macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,4290822,True,"Yes, the condition of severe nonproliferative retinopathy with clinically significant macular edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). This is because diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in individuals with longstanding or poorly controlled diabetes. The presence of severe nonproliferative retinopathy with macular edema is a strong indicator of long-standing hyperglycemia, which is a hallmark of T1DM. Additionally, the description of the malady mentions complications such as retinopathy, further supporting the association between this condition and T1DM. Therefore, if an individual has this specific condition, they definitely have T1DM."
Diabetic ketoacidosis,443727,True,"Yes, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). DKA is a serious complication of T1DM that occurs when there is a severe lack of insulin, leading to the body breaking down fat for energy and producing ketones. This results in high blood sugar levels, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis. While DKA can also occur in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus under certain circumstances, it is more commonly associated with T1DM due to the absolute insulin deficiency characteristic of the disease. Therefore, if someone has DKA, they most likely have T1DM."
Poorly controlled type I diabetes with complication,3196797,True,"Yes, the condition of poorly controlled type I diabetes with complications is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

The description of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus includes the fact that it is characterized by hyperglycemia due to insulin deficiency, which can lead to complications if not properly managed. Poorly controlled diabetes can result in various complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy, all of which are associated with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, if someone has poorly controlled Type 1 diabetes with complications, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Diabetic ulcer right great toe,3183485,True,"Yes, the condition ""Diabetic ulcer right great toe"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Diabetic ulcers are a common complication of diabetes, particularly in patients with poor glycemic control. The presence of a diabetic ulcer, especially on the great toe, is highly indicative of diabetes, particularly Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This is because the chronic hyperglycemia and impaired wound healing associated with diabetes can lead to the development of ulcers, particularly on the lower extremities. Additionally, the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus can lead to complications such as peripheral neuropathy, which can contribute to the development of diabetic ulcers. Therefore, if a patient presents with a diabetic ulcer on the right great toe, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Ketoacidosis due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,443734,False,"No, ketoacidosis due to type 2 diabetes mellitus is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is more commonly associated with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, it can also occur in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, especially in cases of severe insulin deficiency. Therefore, the presence of ketoacidosis due to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Additional testing and evaluation would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in this case."
Arthropathy,73553,False,"No

Rationale: Arthropathy refers to any disease or abnormality of a joint. While arthropathy can be a complication of diabetes, it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, having arthropathy does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Coma due to diabetes mellitus,443735,True,"Yes, the condition ""Coma due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

A coma due to diabetes mellitus, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), is a serious complication of T1DM characterized by extremely high blood sugar levels, dehydration, and the presence of ketones in the blood and urine. DKA is more commonly associated with T1DM than with other types of diabetes. Therefore, if a person is in a coma due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM. On the other hand, not all individuals with T1DM will experience DKA or coma, as it is a severe complication that can occur in certain circumstances such as missed insulin doses or illness."
Disorder of nervous system due to diabetes mellitus,443730,True,"Yes, the condition ""Disorder of nervous system due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Diabetes mellitus, including T1DM, is known to cause damage to the nervous system over time, leading to a variety of neurological complications. These complications can include peripheral neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and other nerve-related issues. Therefore, if someone has a disorder of the nervous system due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM as the underlying cause."
Peripheral circulatory disorder due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,443729,False,"No, the condition ""Peripheral circulatory disorder due to type 2 diabetes mellitus"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This condition specifically mentions type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is a different type of diabetes than Type 1. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leading to absolute insulin deficiency, whereas Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Therefore, if someone has a peripheral circulatory disorder due to type 2 diabetes mellitus, they do not necessarily have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Foot ulcer due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,43530690,False,"No

Rationale: A foot ulcer due to type 2 diabetes mellitus specifically indicates that the individual has type 2 diabetes mellitus, not type 1 diabetes mellitus. While both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can lead to complications such as foot ulcers, the presence of a foot ulcer due to type 2 diabetes does not definitively mean that the individual has type 1 diabetes."
Multiple malformation syndrome with facial defects as major feature,4274970,False,"No, the condition ""Multiple malformation syndrome with facial defects as major feature"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This condition refers to a syndrome characterized by multiple physical abnormalities, particularly involving facial features. While some genetic syndromes may be associated with both facial defects and diabetes, the presence of facial defects alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of T1DM in a patient with this condition."
Myasthenic syndrome due to thyrotoxicosis,4102498,False,"No

Rationale: Myasthenic syndrome due to thyrotoxicosis is a condition characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue due to overactivity of the thyroid gland. While it can present with symptoms similar to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus such as weight loss and fatigue, it is not specific to T1DM. Therefore, having myasthenic syndrome due to thyrotoxicosis does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Macular retinal edema,4290333,False,"No

Rationale: Macular retinal edema is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, macular retinal edema can also occur in other conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, and inflammatory conditions. Therefore, the presence of macular retinal edema does not definitively indicate Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Osteomyelitis,141663,False,"No, osteomyelitis is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Osteomyelitis is a bone infection caused by bacteria or fungi, which can occur in individuals with or without diabetes. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, may be at a higher risk for infections due to compromised immune function, osteomyelitis can occur in individuals without diabetes as well. Therefore, having osteomyelitis does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Diabetic - poor control,443238,True,"Yes, the condition ""Diabetic - poor control"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Patients with T1DM can experience poor control of their blood glucose levels, leading to hyperglycemia. This can result in symptoms such as increased thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), increased hunger (polyphagia), weight loss, and fatigue. 

Since T1DM is characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, individuals with this condition require lifelong insulin replacement therapy to manage their blood glucose levels. Poor control of diabetes in T1DM can lead to serious complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and long-term complications like cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. 

Therefore, if a patient with T1DM is experiencing poor control of their diabetes, it is indicative of the malady itself."
Gastroparesis due to diabetes mellitus,37017430,True,"Yes, the condition of gastroparesis due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Gastroparesis is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in individuals with longstanding poorly controlled diabetes. It is characterized by delayed gastric emptying, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, early satiety, and abdominal pain. In the context of diabetes, gastroparesis is often due to autonomic neuropathy affecting the nerves that control the stomach muscles. Therefore, if an individual has gastroparesis due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Disorder of macula due to diabetes mellitus,4334884,True,"Yes, the condition ""Disorder of macula due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale:
Diabetes mellitus, both Type 1 and Type 2, is a known risk factor for the development of diabetic retinopathy, which is a common complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina. The macula is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. Therefore, a disorder of the macula due to diabetes mellitus would be a specific complication of diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Multiple complications due to diabetes mellitus,40480000,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Multiple complications due to diabetes mellitus"" is a broad term that encompasses a range of complications that can occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. While Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy, these complications are not specific only to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, having multiple complications due to diabetes mellitus does not definitively indicate that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Labor and delivery complicated by fetal heart rate anomaly,443247,False,"No, the condition ""Labor and delivery complicated by fetal heart rate anomaly"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While it is possible for a pregnant woman with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus to experience complications during labor and delivery, such as fetal heart rate anomalies, this condition can occur in pregnant women without diabetes as well. Fetal heart rate anomalies can be caused by a variety of factors unrelated to diabetes, such as umbilical cord compression, placental insufficiency, or fetal distress. Therefore, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Chronic disease of cardiovascular system,4028244,False,"No, the condition ""Chronic disease of cardiovascular system"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). While individuals with T1DM are at an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease as a complication of their diabetes, having a chronic disease of the cardiovascular system does not definitively mean that a person has T1DM. There are many other factors and conditions that can contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, the presence of a chronic disease of the cardiovascular system does not necessarily indicate the presence of T1DM."
Polyneuropathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,37017432,False,"No

Rationale: Polyneuropathy is a common complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the specific condition mentioned, ""Polyneuropathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,"" indicates that it is specifically associated with type 2 diabetes. Since the malady in question is Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, it is not specific to this condition. Therefore, having polyneuropathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus does not necessarily mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus,376683,True,"Yes, the condition of nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Nonproliferative retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, both Type 1 and Type 2. In T1DM, the chronic hyperglycemia can lead to damage of the small blood vessels in the retina, resulting in nonproliferative retinopathy. Therefore, if a patient has nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM."
Gestational diabetes mellitus,4024659,False,"No

Rationale: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). While GDM can increase the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the future, it is a separate condition that is not directly related to the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells seen in T1DM. Therefore, having GDM does not necessarily mean that an individual has T1DM."
Very severe nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus,4269871,True,"Yes, the condition of very severe nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, and the presence of very severe nonproliferative retinopathy indicates long-standing and poorly controlled diabetes. Since T1DM is characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas leading to absolute insulin deficiency, individuals with T1DM are at a higher risk of developing complications such as retinopathy. Therefore, if someone has very severe nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM."
Ischemic ulcer of foot due to diabetes mellitus,4063569,True,"Yes

Rationale: An ischemic ulcer of the foot due to diabetes mellitus is a specific condition that is directly related to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Ischemic ulcers are a common complication of diabetes, particularly in cases of poor blood circulation to the extremities. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells can lead to complications such as peripheral vascular disease, which can result in ischemic ulcers. Therefore, if a patient has an ischemic ulcer of the foot due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Non-high-risk proliferative retinopathy with clinically significant macular edema due to diabetes mellitus,4269870,True,"Yes

Rationale: The condition described, non-high-risk proliferative retinopathy with clinically significant macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, is a specific complication of diabetes mellitus. In this case, the presence of this condition indicates that the individual definitely has diabetes mellitus, which aligns with the description of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus provided. Therefore, if someone has non-high-risk proliferative retinopathy with clinically significant macular edema due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Disorder of eye due to diabetes mellitus,443767,True,"Yes, the condition ""Disorder of eye due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It is a disorder of the eye that can lead to vision loss and blindness if left untreated. The chronic hyperglycemia in T1DM can damage the blood vessels in the retina, leading to diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, if a person has a disorder of the eye due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Mild nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus,378743,True,"Yes, the condition of mild nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, and it typically occurs in individuals with longstanding and poorly controlled diabetes. In the case of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the chronic hyperglycemia resulting from insulin deficiency can lead to damage to the blood vessels in the retina, causing retinopathy. Therefore, if an individual has mild nonproliferative retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

On the other hand, not all individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus will develop retinopathy, especially in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, having Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus does not necessarily mean that an individual will have retinopathy."
Gangrene due to diabetes mellitus,4226354,True,"Yes, gangrene due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Gangrene is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly in cases of uncontrolled hyperglycemia. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency, which can result in poorly controlled blood glucose levels. Persistent hyperglycemia can damage blood vessels and nerves, leading to poor circulation and nerve damage, which are risk factors for developing gangrene. Therefore, if a patient has gangrene due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Lipids abnormal,4042056,False,"No, the condition ""Lipids abnormal"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Abnormal lipid levels can be seen in a variety of conditions, including but not limited to metabolic syndrome, obesity, hypothyroidism, and familial hypercholesterolemia. While individuals with T1DM may also have abnormal lipid levels, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having abnormal lipids does not definitively mean that a person has T1DM."
Hypertension concurrent and due to end stage renal disease on dialysis,45772751,False,"No

Rationale: Hypertension concurrent and due to end-stage renal disease on dialysis is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may develop end-stage renal disease and require dialysis, hypertension can be caused by a variety of factors unrelated to diabetes. Therefore, having hypertension concurrent with end-stage renal disease on dialysis does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Chronic osteomyelitis of ankle and/or foot,137077,False,"No

Rationale:
Chronic osteomyelitis of the ankle and/or foot is a condition involving a chronic bone infection in the ankle and/or foot. While this condition may be present in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) due to the potential impact of diabetes on the immune system and wound healing, it is not specific to T1DM. Chronic osteomyelitis can occur in individuals without T1DM as well, due to various other factors such as trauma, surgery, or other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, having chronic osteomyelitis of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Lesion of skin due to diabetes mellitus,37110593,True,"Yes, a lesion of the skin due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes mellitus, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes can lead to damage of blood vessels and nerves, resulting in poor wound healing and increased susceptibility to skin infections. Therefore, if a person has a skin lesion due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Peripheral arterial occlusive disease,317309,False,"No

Rationale:
Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may develop peripheral arterial occlusive disease as a complication of their diabetes, it is not a defining characteristic of T1DM. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease can also occur in individuals without diabetes due to other risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Therefore, having peripheral arterial occlusive disease does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Pregnancy-induced hypertension,4167493,False,"No

Rationale:
Pregnancy-induced hypertension is a condition that occurs during pregnancy and is characterized by high blood pressure. While pregnancy-induced hypertension can occur in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, it is not specific to this malady. There are various other factors that can lead to pregnancy-induced hypertension, such as pre-existing hypertension, obesity, multiple gestations, and certain medical conditions. Therefore, having pregnancy-induced hypertension does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Intrapartum hemorrhage,4242238,False,"No, intrapartum hemorrhage is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Intrapartum hemorrhage refers to excessive bleeding during childbirth, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as placental abruption, uterine rupture, or placenta previa. While women with diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, may have an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth, intrapartum hemorrhage is not a defining characteristic of T1DM. It is important to address and manage intrapartum hemorrhage promptly to ensure the safety of both the mother and the baby, regardless of the presence of T1DM."
Proteinuria,75650,False,"No

Rationale: Proteinuria, which is the presence of excess protein in the urine, is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While proteinuria can be a complication of diabetes, it is not exclusive to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and can also be seen in other conditions such as kidney disease, hypertension, and certain infections. Therefore, having proteinuria does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Severe pre-eclampsia,433536,False,"No

Rationale:
Severe pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-related condition characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to other organ systems, typically occurring after 20 weeks of gestation. While pre-eclampsia can lead to complications such as gestational diabetes, it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The presence of severe pre-eclampsia does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM, as they are distinct medical conditions with different etiologies and diagnostic criteria."
Ischemia of retina due to diabetes mellitus,35626905,True,"Yes, the condition ""Ischemia of retina due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). In T1DM, the chronic hyperglycemia can lead to damage to blood vessels, including those in the retina, resulting in ischemia. This condition is a known complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly in Type 1 diabetes, and is a result of the microvascular complications associated with the disease. Therefore, if a patient has ischemia of the retina due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Anemia during the puerperium,4209094,False,"No

Rationale: Anemia during the puerperium (postpartum period) is a common condition characterized by a decrease in red blood cell count or hemoglobin levels following childbirth. While anemia can occur in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) due to various factors such as poor glycemic control leading to kidney damage and subsequent anemia of chronic disease, the presence of anemia during the puerperium is not specific to T1DM. Anemia during the puerperium can occur in individuals without T1DM as well, due to factors such as blood loss during childbirth, iron deficiency, or other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, the presence of anemia during the puerperium does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM."
Retinal edema due to diabetes mellitus,35626904,True,"Yes, retinal edema due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Retinal edema is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly in patients with longstanding uncontrolled hyperglycemia. In T1DM, the chronic hyperglycemia can lead to damage to the blood vessels in the retina, resulting in leakage of fluid and the development of retinal edema. Therefore, if a patient presents with retinal edema due to diabetes mellitus, it is highly likely that they have T1DM, as this condition is a specific complication of this particular type of diabetes."
Ulcer of midfoot,46269765,False,"No

Rationale: An ulcer of the midfoot is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1, are at an increased risk of developing foot ulcers due to complications such as neuropathy and poor circulation, there are various other causes of foot ulcers such as trauma, infection, and vascular diseases. Therefore, having an ulcer of the midfoot does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Vitreous hemorrhage,315276,False,"No

Rationale:
Vitreous hemorrhage is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM are at an increased risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, which can lead to vitreous hemorrhage, there are other causes of vitreous hemorrhage such as trauma, retinal tears, retinal detachment, and other eye conditions. Therefore, having vitreous hemorrhage does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
High risk pregnancy,4188598,False,"No, high-risk pregnancy is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While women with T1DM may have a high-risk pregnancy due to potential complications such as pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and macrosomia, not all high-risk pregnancies are due to T1DM. High-risk pregnancies can be caused by a variety of factors such as advanced maternal age, multiple gestations, pre-existing medical conditions, and previous pregnancy complications. Therefore, having a high-risk pregnancy does not definitively mean that a person has T1DM."
Polyneuropathy,4174262,False,"No

Rationale:
Polyneuropathy is a condition characterized by damage to multiple peripheral nerves, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain in the extremities. While polyneuropathy can be a complication of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), it is not specific to T1DM. Polyneuropathy can also be caused by other conditions such as vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, infections, and toxic exposures. Therefore, having polyneuropathy does not definitively mean that a person has T1DM."
Vascular disorder,443784,False,"No, a vascular disorder is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at an increased risk for developing vascular complications such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy, having a vascular disorder does not necessarily mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Vascular disorders can have various causes and can occur in individuals without diabetes as well."
Loss of hypoglycemic warning due to diabetes mellitus,4016047,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Loss of hypoglycemic warning due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

In T1DM, individuals may experience a loss of hypoglycemic warning signs, also known as hypoglycemia unawareness, due to the chronic nature of the disease and the potential for recurrent episodes of low blood sugar. This can be a dangerous complication as it may lead to severe hypoglycemia without the individual being aware of it, increasing the risk of serious complications such as seizures, loss of consciousness, or even death.

Therefore, if an individual with diabetes mellitus experiences a loss of hypoglycemic warning signs, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complication,4193704,False,"No, the condition ""Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complication"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a different form of diabetes characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. While both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes involve issues with insulin and blood sugar regulation, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. 

Therefore, having Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complication does not definitively mean that a person has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It is possible to have Type 2 diabetes without having Type 1 diabetes."
Non-diabetic hypoglycemic coma,4048805,False,"No

Rationale:
Non-diabetic hypoglycemic coma refers to a state of severely low blood sugar levels leading to unconsciousness in individuals who do not have diabetes. This condition is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, as it can occur in individuals without diabetes due to various reasons such as excessive alcohol consumption, certain medications, liver disease, tumors, or other medical conditions. While hypoglycemia can be a complication of diabetes, the presence of non-diabetic hypoglycemic coma does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus in pregnancy,43531010,False,"No, pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus in pregnancy is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Rationale: Pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus in pregnancy refers to a condition where a woman has type 2 diabetes before becoming pregnant. This condition is distinct from Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, which is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leading to insulin deficiency. While both conditions involve diabetes, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus in pregnancy does not definitively mean that a person has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma,4045731,True,"Yes, the condition ""Myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, often caused by autoantibodies targeting acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Thymoma, a tumor of the thymus gland, is commonly associated with myasthenia gravis. 

While myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma is not a direct symptom or characteristic of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the fact that it is specifically mentioned in the context of T1DM suggests a potential association between the two conditions. Additionally, autoimmune disorders like T1DM and myasthenia gravis often coexist in individuals, further supporting the specificity of this condition to T1DM. 

Therefore, if a patient has myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma, they may also have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, making this condition specific to the malady."
Chronic kidney disease due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,43531578,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic kidney disease due to type 2 diabetes mellitus is specifically linked to type 2 diabetes, not type 1 diabetes mellitus. While both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can lead to complications such as chronic kidney disease, this particular condition is not specific to type 1 diabetes mellitus. In this case, having chronic kidney disease due to type 2 diabetes mellitus does not necessarily mean that the individual has type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Broken skin,4082582,False,"No, broken skin is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Broken skin can be caused by a variety of factors such as trauma, infections, dermatological conditions, or even simple cuts and scrapes. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may be at a higher risk for delayed wound healing due to poor circulation and neuropathy, broken skin alone is not a definitive indicator of this specific malady."
Abnormal metabolic state due to diabetes mellitus,4034964,True,"Yes, the condition ""Abnormal metabolic state due to diabetes mellitus"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). T1DM is characterized by absolute insulin deficiency, leading to hyperglycemia and abnormal metabolic states. Therefore, if someone has an abnormal metabolic state due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have T1DM as it is a defining feature of the disease."
Diabetic dermopathy,4033942,False,"No

Rationale: Diabetic dermopathy, also known as shin spots or pigmented pretibial patches, is a common skin condition that occurs in individuals with diabetes, both type 1 and type 2. It presents as small, round, brown or red scaly patches on the skin, typically on the shins. While it is more commonly associated with diabetes, it is not specific to type 1 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, having diabetic dermopathy does not definitively mean that an individual has type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Complication due to diabetes mellitus,442793,False,"No

Rationale:
While complications due to diabetes mellitus can occur in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), they are not specific to T1DM. Complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy can also occur in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus or other forms of diabetes. Therefore, having a complication due to diabetes mellitus does not definitively mean that an individual has T1DM."
Pre-existing diabetes mellitus,44793114,True,"Yes, pre-existing diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. If a person has pre-existing diabetes mellitus, they definitely have the malady of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This is because pre-existing diabetes mellitus refers to a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus that was present before a certain point in time, and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is a specific type of diabetes mellitus characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leading to insulin deficiency. Therefore, if someone has pre-existing diabetes mellitus, it would be classified as Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Oligohydramnios,434111,False,"No

Rationale:
Oligohydramnios is a condition characterized by a decreased volume of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus in the uterus during pregnancy. While oligohydramnios can be associated with certain complications such as fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and umbilical cord compression, it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Oligohydramnios is more commonly associated with conditions such as preeclampsia, fetal anomalies, and placental insufficiency. Therefore, the presence of oligohydramnios does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Ketoacidosis,4209145,True,"Yes, the condition of Ketoacidosis is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Ketoacidosis is a serious complication of T1DM that occurs when there is a lack of insulin in the body, leading to the breakdown of fats for energy and the production of ketones. This results in a state of metabolic acidosis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. Therefore, if a person has Ketoacidosis, they definitely have T1DM as it is a direct consequence of insulin deficiency in this specific type of diabetes."
Diabetic foot,4087682,True,"Yes, the condition ""Diabetic foot"" is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Rationale: A diabetic foot is a common complication of diabetes, particularly in individuals with poorly controlled blood glucose levels. It is characterized by neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and impaired wound healing, which can lead to foot ulcers, infections, and in severe cases, amputation. Since T1DM is associated with long-term complications such as neuropathy and vascular disease, individuals with T1DM are at a higher risk of developing diabetic foot. Therefore, if someone has a diabetic foot, it is highly likely that they have T1DM."
Primary hypogonadism,4153218,False,"No, primary hypogonadism is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Primary hypogonadism refers to a condition where the testes or ovaries produce little to no sex hormones, leading to symptoms such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, infertility, and fatigue. While hypogonadism can be seen in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having primary hypogonadism does not necessarily mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Poorly controlled type I diabetes with circulatory disorder,3198350,True,"Yes, the condition of poorly controlled type I diabetes with circulatory disorder is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

The presence of poorly controlled type I diabetes indicates that the individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, as described in the malady. The term ""poorly controlled"" suggests that the individual is not effectively managing their diabetes, leading to complications such as circulatory disorders. Circulatory disorders are common complications of diabetes, including peripheral vascular disease, which can lead to poor circulation in the extremities. Therefore, the presence of both poorly controlled type I diabetes and a circulatory disorder is indicative of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Persistent proteinuria,36712846,False,"No

Rationale: Persistent proteinuria is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While proteinuria can be a complication of diabetes, it is not exclusive to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and can be present in other conditions such as chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and other forms of diabetes. Therefore, having persistent proteinuria does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Neuropathy in acromegaly,4046335,False,"No

Rationale: Neuropathy in acromegaly is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Neuropathy, which refers to nerve damage that can cause tingling, numbness, or pain, can occur in various medical conditions, including diabetes, but it is not a defining characteristic of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Acromegaly is a disorder caused by excessive growth hormone production, typically due to a pituitary tumor, and can lead to various complications, including neuropathy. Therefore, the presence of neuropathy in acromegaly does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Ulcer of toe,4103165,False,"No

Rationale:
An ulcer of the toe is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM are at higher risk for developing foot ulcers due to complications such as neuropathy and poor circulation, the presence of an ulcer on the toe does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM. Ulcers on the toe can be caused by a variety of factors such as trauma, infection, or poor circulation unrelated to diabetes. Therefore, the presence of an ulcer on the toe does not necessarily mean that an individual has T1DM."
Neuropathic arthropathy due to diabetes mellitus,4114427,True,"Yes, neuropathic arthropathy due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Neuropathic arthropathy, also known as Charcot joint, is a condition characterized by progressive degeneration of a joint due to loss of sensation and proprioception, often seen in patients with diabetes mellitus. In T1DM, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells can lead to complications such as neuropathy, which can in turn result in neuropathic arthropathy. Therefore, if a patient has neuropathic arthropathy due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have T1DM."
Mixed hyperlipidemia,438720,False,"No

Rationale: Mixed hyperlipidemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of both cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may have dyslipidemia as a complication, mixed hyperlipidemia is not specific to T1DM. It can be present in various other conditions such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypothyroidism, and familial hyperlipidemias. Therefore, having mixed hyperlipidemia does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Hypertensive disorder,316866,False,"No

Rationale: Hypertensive disorder is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may also have hypertension as a comorbidity, having a hypertensive disorder does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Hypertension is a common condition that can occur independently of diabetes and has multiple causes, including lifestyle factors, genetics, and other medical conditions."
Charcot's arthropathy,4234127,False,"No

Rationale:
Charcot's arthropathy, also known as Charcot joint, is a condition characterized by progressive destruction of a weight-bearing joint, usually in the foot or ankle, due to nerve damage and loss of sensation. It is commonly associated with conditions such as diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes, but can also be seen in other conditions such as syphilis, leprosy, and chronic alcoholism. While Charcot's arthropathy can be a complication of diabetes, it is not specific to type 1 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, having Charcot's arthropathy does not definitively mean that an individual has type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Drug-induced diabetes mellitus,4202383,False,"No, drug-induced diabetes mellitus is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Drug-induced diabetes mellitus refers to diabetes that is caused by certain medications or substances, rather than autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. While drug-induced diabetes mellitus can present with similar symptoms such as hyperglycemia, it is not necessarily indicative of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, having drug-induced diabetes mellitus does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Disorder of eye,375252,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of eye"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at risk for developing diabetic retinopathy, a disorder of the eye that can lead to vision loss, not all individuals with a disorder of the eye have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. There are many other potential causes of eye disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma, and other systemic conditions. Therefore, the presence of a disorder of the eye does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Hypoglycemia due to diabetes mellitus,4029423,True,"Yes, hypoglycemia due to diabetes mellitus is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). In T1DM, the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas leads to absolute insulin deficiency, which can result in hypoglycemia when too much insulin is administered or not enough food is consumed. Hypoglycemia is a common complication of T1DM and is not typically seen in other types of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, if a patient has hypoglycemia due to diabetes mellitus, they definitely have T1DM."
Traction detachment of retina,375249,False,"No

Rationale:
Traction detachment of the retina is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1, are at an increased risk for developing diabetic retinopathy, which can lead to retinal detachment, traction detachment of the retina can occur due to other causes such as trauma, inflammatory conditions, or other eye disorders. Therefore, having traction detachment of the retina does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Hyperosmolality,444369,False,"No

Rationale:
Hyperosmolality is a condition characterized by an increased concentration of osmotically active particles in the blood, leading to dehydration and potential neurological symptoms. While hyperosmolality can be a complication of uncontrolled diabetes, it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It can also occur in other conditions such as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome, dehydration, hypernatremia, and hypercalcemia. Therefore, the presence of hyperosmolality does not definitively indicate Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Ulcer of heel,443358,False,"No

Rationale: An ulcer of the heel is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1, are at an increased risk of developing foot ulcers due to neuropathy and poor circulation, an ulcer of the heel can be caused by various other factors such as pressure, trauma, or infection. Therefore, having an ulcer of the heel does not definitively mean that an individual has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
"Gestation period, 38 weeks",443871,False,"No, the condition of gestation period, 38 weeks is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While gestational diabetes can occur during pregnancy, it is a separate condition from Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and typically resolves after giving birth. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic autoimmune disorder that is not specifically related to the gestation period."
Gangrene due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,4222876,False,"No

Rationale: Gangrene is a condition that results from poor blood circulation and tissue death, typically due to bacterial infection or lack of blood flow. While individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of developing gangrene due to complications such as peripheral artery disease and neuropathy, gangrene itself is not specific to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, having gangrene does not definitively mean that an individual has type 2 diabetes mellitus."
Proliferative retinopathy,45757798,True,"Yes, proliferative retinopathy is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Proliferative retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that specifically occurs in individuals with diabetes, particularly those with poorly controlled blood sugar levels over a long period of time. In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, the chronic hyperglycemia can lead to damage to the blood vessels in the retina, resulting in proliferative retinopathy. Therefore, if an individual has proliferative retinopathy, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Complication occurring during labor and delivery,440795,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition ""Complication occurring during labor and delivery"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may experience complications during labor and delivery due to their condition, the presence of this complication does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM. Complications during labor and delivery can occur for a variety of reasons unrelated to T1DM, such as fetal distress, placental abruption, or maternal hypertension. Therefore, the condition is not specific to the malady."
Ulcer of foot,74719,False,"No

Rationale: An ulcer of the foot is a common complication of diabetes, but it is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Ulcers of the foot can occur in various conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and other types of diabetes. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus are at an increased risk of developing foot ulcers due to complications such as neuropathy and poor circulation, the presence of an ulcer of the foot alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Arthropathy associated with a neurological disorder,74723,False,"No

Rationale: Arthropathy associated with a neurological disorder is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may develop arthropathy as a complication of the disease, arthropathy associated with a neurological disorder can be caused by a variety of other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or Charcot joint in the setting of neuropathy. Therefore, having arthropathy associated with a neurological disorder does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM."
Microalbuminuric diabetic nephropathy,4128221,True,"Yes

Rationale: Microalbuminuric diabetic nephropathy is a specific complication of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. It is characterized by the presence of small amounts of albumin in the urine, indicating early kidney damage due to diabetes. Therefore, if a patient has microalbuminuric diabetic nephropathy, they definitely have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Diabetic ulcer of left great toe,3178971,True,"Yes, the condition of a diabetic ulcer of the left great toe is specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). 

Diabetic ulcers are a common complication of diabetes, particularly in patients with longstanding uncontrolled hyperglycemia. The presence of a diabetic ulcer, especially on the lower extremities such as the great toe, is highly indicative of diabetes, particularly Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This is because the chronic hyperglycemia and impaired wound healing associated with diabetes can lead to the development of ulcers, particularly in areas of high pressure or trauma.

Furthermore, the description of T1DM mentions complications such as neuropathy, which can lead to decreased sensation in the feet and increase the risk of developing ulcers. Therefore, if a patient presents with a diabetic ulcer of the left great toe, it is highly likely that they have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Type 2 diabetes mellitus with peripheral angiopathy,4200875,False,"No

Rationale: The condition provided, Type 2 diabetes mellitus with peripheral angiopathy, is specific to Type 2 diabetes mellitus and not Type 1 diabetes mellitus. While both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus are characterized by hyperglycemia, they have different underlying causes. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disorder leading to insulin deficiency, while Type 2 diabetes mellitus is typically associated with insulin resistance. Additionally, peripheral angiopathy is a complication more commonly seen in Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, having Type 2 diabetes mellitus with peripheral angiopathy does not necessarily mean that an individual has Type 1 diabetes mellitus."
Subacute osteomyelitis,4284844,False,"No

Rationale: Subacute osteomyelitis is a bone infection that is not specifically associated with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM may be at a higher risk for infections due to their compromised immune system, the presence of subacute osteomyelitis does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM. It is important to consider other factors and diagnostic criteria specific to T1DM when assessing for this condition."
Complication,433128,False,"No, the condition ""Complication"" is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Complications can arise from various medical conditions, not just T1DM. While T1DM can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy, these complications are not exclusive to T1DM and can occur in other diseases as well. Therefore, having a complication does not definitively mean that a person has T1DM."
Kidney disease,198124,False,"No, kidney disease is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While kidney disease can be a complication of uncontrolled diabetes, it is not exclusive to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Kidney disease can have various causes such as hypertension, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and other conditions. Therefore, having kidney disease does not definitively mean that a person has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Chronic ulcer of foot,4181965,False,"No

Rationale: A chronic ulcer of the foot is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with T1DM are at an increased risk of developing foot ulcers due to complications such as neuropathy and poor circulation, the presence of a chronic foot ulcer does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM. Chronic foot ulcers can have various causes such as peripheral vascular disease, trauma, infection, or other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, the condition of a chronic foot ulcer is not specific to T1DM."
Necrosis of ankle bone co-occurrent and due to chronic ulcer of ankle,46269751,False,"No, necrosis of ankle bone co-occurrent and due to chronic ulcer of ankle is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with diabetes, including Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, are at an increased risk for developing chronic ulcers due to complications such as neuropathy and poor wound healing, necrosis of the ankle bone specifically due to a chronic ulcer can have various causes beyond diabetes. Other potential causes may include peripheral vascular disease, infection, trauma, or other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
"Gestation period, 37 weeks",442355,False,"No, the condition of gestation period, 37 weeks is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This condition refers to the length of a pregnancy, specifically 37 weeks, and does not directly relate to the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas that characterizes T1DM. While gestational diabetes can occur during pregnancy, it is a separate condition from T1DM. Therefore, having a gestation period of 37 weeks does not definitively indicate the presence of T1DM."
Dermopathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,43531616,False,"No, Dermopathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Dermopathy is a skin condition commonly associated with diabetes, but it is more commonly seen in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus rather than type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency, while type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Therefore, the presence of Dermopathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Intellectual disability,40277917,False,"No, intellectual disability is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may also have intellectual disabilities, having an intellectual disability does not necessarily mean that a person has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Intellectual disability is a separate condition characterized by limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviors, and it can have various causes unrelated to diabetes."
Cranial nerve disorder,441848,False,"No, a cranial nerve disorder is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may experience various neurological complications, including cranial nerve disorders, the presence of a cranial nerve disorder does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Cranial nerve disorders can have various causes, including infections, tumors, trauma, and other medical conditions unrelated to diabetes. Therefore, a cranial nerve disorder is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus."
Reticulosarcoma of intrathoracic lymph nodes,435193,False,"No. Reticulosarcoma of intrathoracic lymph nodes is not specific to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Reticulosarcoma, also known as Hodgkin lymphoma, is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. While individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus may have an increased risk of certain cancers, including lymphomas, the presence of reticulosarcoma of intrathoracic lymph nodes does not definitively indicate the presence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The two conditions are distinct entities with different pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria."
