Therefore, having cardiac septal defects does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiomyopathy,321319,False,"No, cardiomyopathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, cardiomyopathy is a broader term that refers to diseases of the heart muscle itself. Cardiomyopathy can have various causes, including genetic factors, infections, toxins, and autoimmune conditions, and can affect the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Therefore, while cardiomyopathy can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to this condition."
Myeloproliferative disorder,4175485,False,"No, myeloproliferative disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While there have been some reported cases of patients with myeloproliferative disorders developing pulmonary hypertension, the presence of a myeloproliferative disorder does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension. Myeloproliferative disorders are a group of conditions characterized by the overproduction of blood cells in the bone marrow, such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. These disorders can lead to various complications, but pulmonary hypertension is not a common or specific manifestation of myeloproliferative disorders."

Pulmonary Hypertension specifically involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which is not directly related to atherosclerosis of the coronary artery."
Left heart failure,439846,False,"No, left heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While left heart failure can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a result of increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature due to left ventricular dysfunction, not all patients with left heart failure will develop pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, there are other causes of pulmonary hypertension unrelated to left heart failure, such as chronic lung diseases or congenital heart defects. Therefore, having left heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Systolic heart failure,443580,False,"No

Rationale: Systolic heart failure is a condition characterized by the inability of the heart to pump effectively, leading to reduced ejection fraction and inadequate circulation of blood. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of systolic heart failure are specifically caused by pulmonary hypertension. There are various other causes of systolic heart failure, such as coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Disorder of right cardiac ventricle,4165905,True,"Yes, a disorder of the right cardiac ventricle is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

In Pulmonary Hypertension, elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, a disorder of the right cardiac ventricle is a common manifestation of Pulmonary Hypertension. Patients with PH may present with signs of right heart failure, which can include symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and syncope. Additionally, diagnostic evaluation for PH involves assessing right heart function through echocardiography and right heart catheterization. Therefore, if a patient has a disorder of the right cardiac ventricle, it is highly likely that they have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Collagen disease,255334,True,"Yes, the condition of collagen disease is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. Collagen diseases, also known as connective tissue diseases, are one of the associated conditions that can lead to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension.

Therefore, if a patient has a collagen disease, they may develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a complication of their underlying condition."
Electrocardiogram abnormal,320536,False,"No, an electrocardiogram abnormality is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have abnormalities on their electrocardiogram due to the strain on the right side of the heart, there are many other conditions and factors that can also cause electrocardiogram abnormalities. Therefore, having an abnormal electrocardiogram does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. Additional diagnostic testing and evaluation would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension."
Primary cardiomyopathy,4232495,False,"No

Rationale: Primary cardiomyopathy is a condition that specifically refers to diseases of the heart muscle itself, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or restrictive cardiomyopathy. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, primary cardiomyopathy is not a specific condition that is always present in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having primary cardiomyopathy does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic systolic heart failure,40479192,False,"No, chronic systolic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, acute heart failure can have various causes such as coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having acute heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Atrial septal defect,4289309,True,"Yes, atrial septal defect (ASD) can be specific to pulmonary hypertension (PH). ASD is a congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormal opening in the atrial septum, leading to shunting of blood between the atria. Over time, this can result in increased blood flow to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has an atrial septal defect, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have an atrial septal defect, as there are various other causes of PH as mentioned in the description of the malady."
Immunodeficiency disorder,433740,False,"No, an immunodeficiency disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with immunodeficiency disorders may be at an increased risk for developing various medical conditions, including pulmonary infections, there is no direct causal relationship between immunodeficiency disorders and Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, which are not directly linked to immunodeficiency disorders."
Chronic kidney disease due to hypertension,44782429,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic kidney disease due to hypertension is a condition that can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, but it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While chronic kidney disease can contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension, there are many other potential causes of pulmonary hypertension as outlined in the description of the malady. Therefore, having chronic kidney disease due to hypertension does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."

The two conditions can coexist but are not directly linked in a cause-and-effect relationship."
Hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure,319034,False,"No, the condition ""Hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension specifically refers to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. The condition ""Hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure"" typically refers to heart disease caused by high blood pressure affecting the left side of the heart, rather than the pulmonary vasculature. While both conditions involve elevated blood pressure, they affect different parts of the heart and vasculature. Therefore, having ""Hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure"" does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypoxemia,437390,True,"Yes, hypoxemia is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Hypoxemia, which is defined as low oxygen levels in the blood, can be a common finding in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension. Due to the elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, the ability of the lungs to oxygenate the blood may be compromised, leading to hypoxemia. Therefore, if a patient has hypoxemia, it is highly likely that they may also have Pulmonary Hypertension. However, not all patients with Pulmonary Hypertension will necessarily have hypoxemia, as the presence of hypoxemia can be influenced by various factors beyond just the pulmonary hypertension itself."
Acute systolic heart failure,40480603,False,"No, acute systolic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, acute systolic heart failure can have various causes such as myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, or valvular heart disease. Therefore, having acute systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."

Chronic respiratory failure,314971,False,"No, chronic respiratory failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Chronic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by the inability of the respiratory system to adequately oxygenate the blood and/or remove carbon dioxide over an extended period of time. While chronic respiratory failure can be a complication of Pulmonary Hypertension due to the progressive nature of the disease and its impact on lung function, it can also be caused by a variety of other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neuromuscular disorders, or obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Therefore, the presence of chronic respiratory failure does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Sarcoidosis,438688,False,"No, sarcoidosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While sarcoidosis can affect the lungs and lead to pulmonary complications, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in various organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. It can present with respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and chest pain, but it is not a direct cause of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having sarcoidosis does not necessarily mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic diastolic heart failure,40479576,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic diastolic heart failure is a condition characterized by impaired relaxation and filling of the heart during diastole, leading to elevated pressures within the heart chambers. While chronic diastolic heart failure can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can be a complication of chronic diastolic heart failure, but not all patients with chronic diastolic heart failure will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having chronic diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Mitral valve stenosis,315273,False,"No, mitral valve stenosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Mitral valve stenosis is a condition where the mitral valve in the heart is narrowed, leading to restricted blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. While mitral valve stenosis can lead to increased pressure in the left side of the heart, it is not directly related to the elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature seen in pulmonary hypertension. These two conditions have different pathophysiologies and etiologies, and a person can have mitral valve stenosis without having pulmonary hypertension."
Abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging of lung,437677,False,"No, abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging of the lung are not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging of the lung can be seen in a variety of respiratory conditions such as pneumonia, lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, or even pulmonary embolism. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to changes in the pulmonary vasculature that may be visible on imaging studies, abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging of the lung alone are not sufficient to diagnose Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic tests such as echocardiography and right heart catheterization are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Venous hypertension,312935,False,"No, venous hypertension is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Venous hypertension refers to high blood pressure in the veins, typically in the lower extremities. While pulmonary hypertension involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, it is a separate condition with different pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria. Venous hypertension may be a comorbidity or contributing factor in some cases of pulmonary hypertension, but it is not a defining characteristic of the disease."
Congenital ventricular septal defect,35625532,True,"Yes, a congenital ventricular septal defect is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

A congenital ventricular septal defect is a type of congenital heart defect where there is an abnormal opening in the wall that separates the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). This defect can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension over time. In the context of the malady of pulmonary hypertension, having a congenital ventricular septal defect can lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension as a result of the increased blood flow and pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, if a patient has a congenital ventricular septal defect, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their underlying heart condition."
Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia,45763749,False,"No, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia refers to a group of lung diseases characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue, which can lead to symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with certain interstitial lung diseases, it is not a defining feature of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Therefore, having idiopathic interstitial pneumonia does not necessarily mean that a person will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiovascular system complication of procedure,43022062,False,"No, the condition ""Cardiovascular system complication of procedure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may undergo procedures that could potentially lead to cardiovascular complications, the presence of a cardiovascular system complication of a procedure does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is a specific condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which is not directly related to complications from procedures. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension in a patient with a cardiovascular system complication of a procedure."
Right ventricular hypertrophy,4231591,True,"Yes, right ventricular hypertrophy is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Right ventricular hypertrophy is a common consequence of Pulmonary Hypertension due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. As the right ventricle works harder to pump blood against the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, it undergoes hypertrophy to adapt to the increased workload. Therefore, if a patient has right ventricular hypertrophy, it is highly likely that they have Pulmonary Hypertension. However, not all patients with Pulmonary Hypertension will present with right ventricular hypertrophy, as it may be an early or subtle finding in some cases."
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure,40480602,False,"No

Rationale: Acute on chronic systolic heart failure is a condition characterized by a sudden worsening of symptoms in a patient with pre-existing heart failure, specifically related to reduced ejection fraction. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have acute on chronic systolic heart failure. Therefore, having acute on chronic systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a patient has pulmonary hypertension."
Acute-on-chronic respiratory failure,312940,False,"No, acute-on-chronic respiratory failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Acute-on-chronic respiratory failure refers to a sudden worsening of respiratory function in a patient with pre-existing chronic respiratory disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or interstitial lung disease. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may experience respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, acute-on-chronic respiratory failure is not a defining characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right heart dysfunction."
Left bundle branch block,316998,False,"No, left bundle branch block is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Left bundle branch block is an electrical conduction abnormality in the heart that can be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG). It is not a direct symptom or sign of pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have underlying heart conditions that could potentially lead to left bundle branch block, the presence of left bundle branch block does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional diagnostic testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in a patient with left bundle branch block."

Rheumatic heart disease is a condition that results from rheumatic fever, which is caused by untreated streptococcal infections. It primarily affects the heart valves, leading to damage and dysfunction. While patients with rheumatic heart disease may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of the disease process, not all patients with rheumatic heart disease will have pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having rheumatic heart disease does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
Disorder of pleura,4338843,False,"No, a disorder of the pleura is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. A disorder of the pleura refers to conditions affecting the pleural membrane surrounding the lungs, such as pleurisy, pleural effusion, or pleural thickening. While these conditions can cause symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath, they are not directly related to the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having a disorder of the pleura does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic peripheral neuropathy,375806,False,"No, idiopathic peripheral neuropathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic peripheral neuropathy refers to nerve damage of unknown cause that affects the peripheral nerves, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and weakness in the extremities. While peripheral neuropathy can be seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is not a specific or defining feature of the condition. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having idiopathic peripheral neuropathy does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Disorder of fascia,134730,False,"No, a disorder of fascia is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily a cardiovascular and pulmonary condition related to elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction. A disorder of fascia typically refers to conditions affecting the connective tissue surrounding muscles and organs, such as fasciitis or fibromyalgia. These conditions are not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congenital anomaly of pulmonary artery,435646,True,"Yes, a congenital anomaly of the pulmonary artery can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Congenital heart defects, including anomalies of the pulmonary artery, can lead to increased pulmonary arterial pressure and ultimately result in pulmonary hypertension. In this case, if a patient has a congenital anomaly of the pulmonary artery, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a consequence of the structural abnormality. Therefore, the presence of this condition can definitely lead to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Portal hypertension,192680,False,"No

Rationale: Portal hypertension is a condition characterized by increased pressure in the portal vein system, which carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver. While both portal hypertension and pulmonary hypertension involve elevated blood pressure, they affect different vascular systems in the body. Portal hypertension is specific to liver-related conditions such as cirrhosis, while pulmonary hypertension primarily affects the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, having portal hypertension does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Hypervolemia,434004,False,"No, hypervolemia is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Hypervolemia refers to an excessive amount of fluid in the blood vessels, which can lead to increased blood pressure and strain on the heart. While hypervolemia can potentially exacerbate symptoms of Pulmonary Hypertension by increasing the workload on the right ventricle, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, rather than simply an excess of fluid in the blood vessels. Therefore, having hypervolemia does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hemolytic anemia,435503,False,"No

Rationale: Hemolytic anemia is a condition characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells, leading to anemia. While hemolytic anemia can be associated with various underlying causes such as autoimmune disorders, infections, or genetic conditions, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop anemia as a secondary complication, the presence of hemolytic anemia alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Acute diastolic heart failure,40481042,False,"No, acute diastolic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Acute diastolic heart failure refers to a sudden onset of heart failure symptoms due to impaired relaxation of the heart muscle during diastole, leading to elevated pressures in the heart chambers. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, not all cases of acute diastolic heart failure are caused by pulmonary hypertension. There are various other causes of acute diastolic heart failure, such as ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and hypertensive heart disease. Therefore, having acute diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Left ventricular abnormality,442982,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, not left ventricular abnormalities. While left heart disease can lead to pulmonary hypertension, the presence of a left ventricular abnormality alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in this case."
Chronic congestive heart failure,4229440,False,"No, chronic congestive heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of chronic congestive heart failure are caused by pulmonary hypertension. Chronic congestive heart failure can have various causes, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, among others. Therefore, having chronic congestive heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."

While Pulmonary Hypertension can be hereditary in some cases, it can also be caused by various other factors such as drug-induced, connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder does not definitively mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Developmental hereditary disorder,4180651,False,"No, the condition of a developmental hereditary disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can be hereditary in some cases, not all cases of Pulmonary Hypertension are due to a developmental hereditary disorder. There are various other causes of Pulmonary Hypertension, as mentioned in the description, such as idiopathic, drug-induced, or associated with other conditions. Therefore, having a developmental hereditary disorder does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Endocardial cushion defect,435912,True,"Yes, endocardial cushion defect is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Endocardial cushion defect, also known as atrioventricular septal defect, is a congenital heart defect that is commonly associated with Pulmonary Hypertension. Patients with endocardial cushion defect often develop pulmonary hypertension due to the increased blood flow and pressure in the pulmonary vasculature caused by the abnormal communication between the atria and ventricles. This increased pressure can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, which are characteristic features of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has endocardial cushion defect, they are likely to develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a result of their underlying heart condition."
Pneumonia due to Gram negative bacteria,258180,False,"No

Rationale: Pneumonia due to Gram-negative bacteria is an infection of the lungs caused by specific types of bacteria. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with chronic lung diseases, it is not specific to pneumonia due to Gram-negative bacteria. Pulmonary hypertension can have various causes, as mentioned in the description, and is not limited to a specific type of infection. Therefore, having pneumonia due to Gram-negative bacteria does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease,257004,False,"No, an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have underlying chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an acute exacerbation of COPD is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, rather than acute exacerbations of chronic lung diseases."
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure,40481043,False,"No

Rationale: Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure is a specific type of heart failure characterized by impaired relaxation of the heart muscle leading to elevated pressures in the left side of the heart. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure will necessarily result in pulmonary hypertension.

Malignant hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure,314369,False,"No, the condition ""Malignant hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Malignant hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure refers to severe high blood pressure affecting the heart, leading to complications such as left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial ischemia, and ultimately heart failure. This condition is primarily related to systemic hypertension and its effects on the heart, rather than the specific pulmonary vascular changes seen in Pulmonary Hypertension. While both conditions involve elevated blood pressure and can lead to heart failure, they have different underlying pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having malignant hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute pulmonary edema,261600,False,"No

Rationale: Acute pulmonary edema is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Acute pulmonary edema is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing, coughing, and potentially life-threatening respiratory distress.

Therefore, having acute pulmonary edema does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Autoimmune connective tissue disorder,4179877,True,"Yes, an autoimmune connective tissue disorder can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Connective tissue disorders, such as systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and systemic lupus erythematosus, are known to be associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension. In these conditions, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues, including blood vessels in the lungs, leading to inflammation and scarring that can result in pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has an autoimmune connective tissue disorder, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their underlying condition."
Idiopathic scoliosis,4069935,False,"No, idiopathic scoliosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic scoliosis is a condition characterized by an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine, typically diagnosed during adolescence. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may have idiopathic scoliosis as a comorbidity, the presence of idiopathic scoliosis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction,40482727,False,"No, combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right ventricular dysfunction, which can manifest as combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction, this condition can also be seen in other cardiac diseases such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the presence of combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction does not definitively indicate Pulmonary Hypertension."
Dependence on respiratory device,46270151,False,"No, dependence on a respiratory device is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may experience symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue that could potentially lead to the need for respiratory support, dependence on a respiratory device can be caused by a variety of other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neuromuscular disorders, or obstructive sleep apnea. Therefore, having a dependence on a respiratory device does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Benign hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure,313502,False,"No, the condition ""Benign hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. The condition mentioned does not specifically mention pulmonary vasculature involvement or right ventricular dysfunction, which are key features of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having the condition ""Benign hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure"" does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypertensive heart failure,444101,False,"No, the condition ""Hypertensive heart failure"" is not specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Hypertensive heart failure refers to heart failure that is caused by high blood pressure, leading to the heart being unable to pump effectively. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, there are many other causes of heart failure, including coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having hypertensive heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Localization-related idiopathic epilepsy,4150299,False,"No, localization-related idiopathic epilepsy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Localization-related idiopathic epilepsy refers to a type of epilepsy where seizures originate from a specific area of the brain and have no identifiable cause. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While some patients with epilepsy may have comorbidities such as pulmonary hypertension, the presence of localization-related idiopathic epilepsy does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."

Certain congenital connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, have been associated with an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. These disorders can affect the structure and function of blood vessels, including those in the lungs, leading to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and the development of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has a congenital connective tissue disorder, they may be at higher risk for developing pulmonary hypertension."
Pneumonia due to Pseudomonas,252351,False,"No, pneumonia due to Pseudomonas is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pneumonia due to Pseudomonas is an infection of the lungs caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may be at increased risk for infections due to their underlying condition, having pneumonia due to Pseudomonas does not necessarily mean that a person also has Pulmonary Hypertension. The two conditions are distinct entities with different etiologies and pathophysiology."
Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease,44784621,False,"No, the condition ""Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension specifically refers to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. On the other hand, ""Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease"" refers to a condition where there is both heart disease related to high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease present. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as fatigue and fluid retention, the underlying pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria for these conditions are different. Therefore, having ""Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease"" does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Venous occlusion,4145867,False,"No, venous occlusion is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Venous occlusion refers to the blockage or obstruction of a vein, which can occur in various parts of the body and can be caused by different conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or venous insufficiency. While venous occlusion can potentially contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension in certain cases, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, as described in the provided description."
Connective tissue hereditary disorder,4176799,True,"Yes, a connective tissue hereditary disorder can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Connective tissue disorders, such as systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) or Marfan syndrome, are known to be associated with the development of Pulmonary Hypertension.

Therefore, if a patient has a connective tissue hereditary disorder, they may be at an increased risk for developing Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypoxemic respiratory failure,37395564,True,"Yes, hypoxemic respiratory failure can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Hypoxemic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by low oxygen levels in the blood, which can be a common symptom in patients with pulmonary hypertension. In PH, the elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature can lead to impaired gas exchange in the lungs, resulting in hypoxemia. Therefore, if a patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure, it is highly likely that they may also have pulmonary hypertension. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will necessarily present with hypoxemic respiratory failure, as the severity and progression of the disease can vary."
Hereditary nephropathy,45757752,False,"No, hereditary nephropathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Hereditary nephropathy refers to a group of inherited kidney diseases that affect the structure and function of the kidneys.

Further evaluation and testing would be needed to determine the specific cause of the pulmonary vein finding."
Congenital anomaly of pulmonary veins,4006984,True,"Yes, a congenital anomaly of pulmonary veins can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Congenital anomalies of pulmonary veins can lead to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, which can contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension. In this case, if a patient has a congenital anomaly of pulmonary veins, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of the abnormal pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, having a congenital anomaly of pulmonary veins can be specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Primary torsion dystonia,378417,False,"No

Rationale: Primary torsion dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions, causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. It is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension, as it primarily affects the central nervous system and does not involve the pulmonary vasculature or right heart dysfunction.

While chronic thromboembolic disease is listed as an exclusion for pulmonary arterial hypertension, not all cases of thromboembolic disorder necessarily lead to pulmonary hypertension. Thromboembolic disorder refers to the formation of blood clots that can travel through the bloodstream and block blood vessels, potentially leading to conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. While these conditions can contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension in some cases, they are not always directly linked. Therefore, having a thromboembolic disorder does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic interstitial cystitis,75863,False,"No, chronic interstitial cystitis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic interstitial cystitis is a chronic bladder condition characterized by bladder pain, urinary frequency, and urgency. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may also have chronic interstitial cystitis, the presence of chronic interstitial cystitis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Hypoventilation,312603,False,"No, hypoventilation is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Hypoventilation refers to a decrease in the rate or depth of breathing, leading to an inadequate exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs. While hypoventilation can occur in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension due to the associated respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, it is not a specific indicator of the condition. Hypoventilation can be caused by a variety of other conditions such as respiratory muscle weakness, central nervous system disorders, or obstructive sleep apnea. Therefore, having hypoventilation does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Aneurysm of heart,438168,False,"No. Aneurysm of the heart is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While both conditions can lead to heart failure, they are distinct entities with different underlying pathophysiology. Aneurysm of the heart refers to a localized, abnormal dilation of a blood vessel in the heart, typically involving the left ventricle. It can be caused by various factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, or previous heart attacks. On the other hand, Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While both conditions can impact heart function, they are not directly related in terms of diagnosis or causation."
Mitochondrial cytopathy,81539,False,"No, mitochondrial cytopathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Mitochondrial cytopathy refers to a group of disorders caused by abnormalities in the mitochondria, which are responsible for producing energy in cells. These disorders can affect various organs and systems in the body, leading to a wide range of symptoms. While mitochondrial dysfunction can potentially contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, which is not directly linked to mitochondrial cytopathy."
Hydrocele of tunica vaginalis,4320332,False,"No, hydrocele of tunica vaginalis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Hydrocele of tunica vaginalis is a common condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the sac surrounding the testicle. It is typically benign and does not directly relate to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. While both conditions can occur concurrently in a patient, the presence of hydrocele of tunica vaginalis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation and assessment would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in a patient with hydrocele of tunica vaginalis."
Congenital atrial septal defect,4236884,True,"Yes, congenital atrial septal defect is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Rationale: A congenital atrial septal defect is a type of congenital heart defect where there is an abnormal opening in the atrial septum, leading to abnormal blood flow between the atria. This abnormal blood flow can cause increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, ultimately leading to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has a congenital atrial septal defect, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of the defect."
Chronic pulmonary embolism,44782732,False,"No, chronic pulmonary embolism is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While chronic pulmonary embolism can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all cases of chronic pulmonary embolism will result in pulmonary hypertension. Chronic pulmonary embolism refers to the long-term effects of a blood clot in the pulmonary arteries, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. It is important to differentiate between the two conditions as they have different underlying causes and treatment approaches."
Hypercapnic respiratory failure,46271074,True,"Yes, hypercapnic respiratory failure can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Hypercapnic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by an elevated level of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can occur in patients with advanced pulmonary hypertension due to the impaired gas exchange and ventilation-perfusion abnormalities associated with the disease. In pulmonary hypertension, the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure can lead to decreased blood flow to the lungs, impairing the ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide effectively. This can result in hypercapnia, which is a common complication in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and can contribute to respiratory symptoms and worsening of the disease. Therefore, if a patient with pulmonary hypertension develops hypercapnic respiratory failure, it is highly likely that the two conditions are related."
Tubulointerstitial nephritis,4177206,False,"No, tubulointerstitial nephritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Tubulointerstitial nephritis is a condition that involves inflammation of the renal tubules and interstitium of the kidney, which can be caused by various factors such as medications, infections, autoimmune diseases, and systemic conditions. While there may be associations between different medical conditions, having tubulointerstitial nephritis does not definitively mean that a person also has pulmonary hypertension. Each condition has its own distinct pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches."
Mitral insufficiency and aortic stenosis,320115,False,"No

Rationale: Mitral insufficiency and aortic stenosis are conditions related to heart valve abnormalities, which can lead to symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. While these conditions can contribute to the development of heart failure, they are not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have underlying heart valve abnormalities, the presence of mitral insufficiency and aortic stenosis alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Metabolic disease of collagen,4250025,False,"No, a metabolic disease of collagen is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can be associated with certain conditions such as connective tissue diseases, including those affecting collagen metabolism, having a metabolic disease of collagen does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension can have various causes and associations, so a specific condition like a metabolic disease of collagen would not always lead to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Extreme obesity with alveolar hypoventilation,4100857,True,"Yes, extreme obesity with alveolar hypoventilation is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Extreme obesity with alveolar hypoventilation, also known as obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), is a condition characterized by the combination of obesity, alveolar hypoventilation (elevated arterial carbon dioxide levels), and sleep-disordered breathing. OHS is a known risk factor for the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. The chronic hypoxemia and hypercapnia associated with OHS can lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction, ultimately contributing to the development of PH. Therefore, if a patient presents with extreme obesity and alveolar hypoventilation, they are at increased risk for developing Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute idiopathic pericarditis,315293,False,"No, acute idiopathic pericarditis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Acute idiopathic pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, which can cause chest pain, fever, and other symptoms. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right heart failure, which can cause symptoms similar to pericarditis, the two conditions are distinct entities with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having acute idiopathic pericarditis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Acute cor pulmonale,312927,True,"Yes, acute cor pulmonale is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Acute cor pulmonale is a condition characterized by a sudden increase in right ventricular afterload, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately, heart failure. It is a complication of pulmonary hypertension, as the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure in PH can cause acute cor pulmonale to develop. Therefore, if a patient has acute cor pulmonale, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension as the underlying cause."
Hypertensive heart AND chronic kidney disease with congestive heart failure,44782728,False,"No, the condition ""Hypertensive heart AND chronic kidney disease with congestive heart failure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. The condition provided in the input does not directly relate to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as heart failure, the specific criteria for diagnosing Pulmonary Hypertension, including the hemodynamic and pathophysiological state characterized by an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure, are not met by the condition provided."
Idiopathic aseptic necrosis of bone,4067774,False,"No, idiopathic aseptic necrosis of bone is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Idiopathic aseptic necrosis of bone refers to a condition where bone tissue dies due to a lack of blood supply, leading to bone collapse and joint damage. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may have other comorbidities or conditions, idiopathic aseptic necrosis of bone is not a defining characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute respiratory distress syndrome,4195694,False,"No

Rationale: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing, low oxygen levels in the blood, and respiratory failure. While ARDS can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all patients with ARDS will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having ARDS does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiovascular system hereditary disorder,4179992,False,"No, the condition ""Cardiovascular system hereditary disorder"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can be hereditary in some cases, not all hereditary cardiovascular disorders lead to Pulmonary Hypertension. There are various other cardiovascular conditions that can be hereditary and do not necessarily result in Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having a hereditary cardiovascular disorder does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure,46273719,False,"No.

Rationale: Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by an elevation of carbon dioxide levels in the blood, often due to inadequate ventilation. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right heart failure and subsequent respiratory symptoms, acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. It can occur in various conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neuromuscular disorders, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome, among others. Therefore, having acute hypercapnic respiratory failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Langerhans cell histiocytosis,4278365,False,"No, Langerhans cell histiocytosis is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by an overproduction of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. It can affect various organs in the body, including the lungs, bones, skin, and other tissues. While Langerhans cell histiocytosis can involve the lungs and potentially lead to pulmonary complications, it is not a defining feature of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having Langerhans cell histiocytosis does not necessarily mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Disorder of pulp of tooth,4238825,False,"No, a disorder of the pulp of a tooth is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. A disorder of the pulp of a tooth refers to issues within the innermost part of the tooth, such as infection or inflammation. This dental condition is unrelated to the complex and progressive cardiovascular condition of Pulmonary Hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. These two conditions are distinct and do not have a direct relationship."
Mixed acid-base balance disorder,441536,False,"No, mixed acid-base balance disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop acid-base imbalances as a result of their condition, mixed acid-base balance disorder can be caused by a variety of other medical conditions and is not exclusive to pulmonary hypertension. It is important to consider the underlying cause of the acid-base disorder when evaluating a patient with this condition."
Hypertensive heart and renal disease with both (congestive) heart failure and renal failure,439694,False,"No, the condition ""Hypertensive heart and renal disease with both (congestive) heart failure and renal failure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. The condition mentioned focuses on heart and renal issues, which are not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension. While heart failure can be a symptom of Pulmonary Hypertension, the specific combination of heart and renal issues described in the condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension in a patient with the mentioned condition."
Idiopathic osteoarthritis,4035439,False,"No, idiopathic osteoarthritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion in the affected joint. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have comorbid conditions such as osteoarthritis, the presence of idiopathic osteoarthritis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure,37016114,False,"No.

Rationale: Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by a sudden worsening of respiratory function in a patient with pre-existing chronic respiratory insufficiency. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to chronic hypoxemia and respiratory failure, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will develop acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure. Therefore, the presence of acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic osteoporosis,81390,False,"No, idiopathic osteoporosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic osteoporosis is a condition characterized by decreased bone density and increased risk of fractures, typically without a known underlying cause. While osteoporosis can be associated with certain medical conditions or medications, it is not directly linked to pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions affect different systems in the body and have distinct pathophysiological mechanisms."
Atrioventricular septal defect and common atrioventricular junction,4100152,True,"Yes, atrioventricular septal defect and common atrioventricular junction can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Atrioventricular septal defect is a congenital heart defect that involves abnormalities in the structure of the heart, specifically the septum between the atria and ventricles. This defect can lead to increased blood flow and pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, which can contribute to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension over time. Additionally, common atrioventricular junction is a related congenital heart anomaly that can also impact the hemodynamics of the heart and lungs, potentially leading to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Therefore, if a patient has atrioventricular septal defect and common atrioventricular junction, they may develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a result of these structural abnormalities in the heart."
Pulmonary sarcoidosis,4086243,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a condition characterized by the formation of granulomas in the lungs, which can lead to symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. While pulmonary sarcoidosis can potentially lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having pulmonary sarcoidosis does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
Benign hypertensive heart disease with congestive cardiac failure,439698,False,"No, the condition ""Benign hypertensive heart disease with congestive cardiac failure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

While both conditions involve elevated blood pressure within the cardiovascular system and can lead to heart failure, they are distinct entities with different underlying pathophysiology. 

Benign hypertensive heart disease with congestive cardiac failure typically refers to heart failure secondary to long-standing high blood pressure affecting the left side of the heart, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention. 

On the other hand, Pulmonary Hypertension specifically involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately, heart failure. The diagnostic criteria for Pulmonary Hypertension include an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest, as assessed by right heart catheterization. 

Therefore, while there may be some overlap in symptoms between the two conditions, having benign hypertensive heart disease with congestive cardiac failure does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congestive rheumatic heart failure,315295,False,"No, congestive rheumatic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While congestive heart failure can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension due to the strain on the right ventricle, it can also be caused by a variety of other conditions such as coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having congestive rheumatic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Pneumonia due to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,46270027,False,"No.

Rationale:
Pulmonary Hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Pneumonia due to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, on the other hand, is a specific type of pneumonia caused by a particular strain of bacteria. While pneumonia can lead to complications such as pulmonary hypertension, having pneumonia due to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, the presence of the condition does not necessarily indicate the presence of the malady."
Chronic passive congestion of liver,200451,False,"No, chronic passive congestion of the liver is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Chronic passive congestion of the liver is a condition that occurs when there is impaired blood flow through the liver, leading to congestion and accumulation of blood within the liver sinusoids. This condition is typically associated with conditions such as congestive heart failure, hepatic vein obstruction, or Budd-Chiari syndrome. While chronic passive congestion of the liver can be seen in patients with advanced Pulmonary Hypertension due to right heart failure and elevated right-sided pressures, it is not a specific indicator of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Benign hypertensive heart AND renal disease,442626,False,"No, benign hypertensive heart AND renal disease is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Benign hypertensive heart AND renal disease refers to a condition where there is hypertrophy of the heart and kidney damage due to long-standing high blood pressure. While hypertension can be a risk factor for developing Pulmonary Hypertension, it is not a specific condition that definitively indicates the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is a separate and distinct condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, having benign hypertensive heart AND renal disease does not necessarily mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Inflammatory disorder of mediastinum,4189294,False,"No, the condition ""Inflammatory disorder of mediastinum"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While inflammation in the mediastinum can potentially be a complication of Pulmonary Hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Inflammatory disorders of the mediastinum may have various causes and are not exclusive to Pulmonary Hypertension."
Central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome,4086499,True,"Yes, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, also known as Ondine's curse, is a condition characterized by a decrease in respiratory drive leading to inadequate ventilation, particularly during sleep. This can result in hypoxemia and hypercapnia. In the context of pulmonary hypertension, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome can exacerbate the already compromised gas exchange and respiratory function, leading to further complications such as worsening hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. Therefore, if a patient with pulmonary hypertension also has central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, it is highly likely that the two conditions are related and that the presence of central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome is specific to the underlying malady of pulmonary hypertension."
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,4259507,False,"No, juvenile idiopathic arthritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While there may be some overlap in patients with connective tissue diseases or other underlying conditions, having juvenile idiopathic arthritis does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can be associated with various etiologies, but it is not a common manifestation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis."
Overlap syndrome,4079978,False,"No, the condition ""Overlap syndrome"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Overlap syndrome refers to the coexistence of features of two or more distinct connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or myositis. While patients with connective tissue diseases may be at an increased risk for developing Pulmonary Hypertension, having an overlap syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension in a patient with an overlap syndrome."
Idiopathic myocarditis,317307,False,"No, idiopathic myocarditis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic myocarditis refers to inflammation of the heart muscle of unknown cause, which can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and heart failure. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, there are many other potential causes of myocarditis besides pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic myocarditis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic sleep related non-obstructive alveolar hypoventilation,40481299,False,"No, idiopathic sleep related non-obstructive alveolar hypoventilation is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While both conditions can affect the respiratory system, they are distinct entities with different pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria. Idiopathic sleep related non-obstructive alveolar hypoventilation is characterized by decreased ventilation during sleep without an obvious cause, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. On the other hand, Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may experience symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, these symptoms are not specific to idiopathic sleep related non-obstructive alveolar hypoventilation. Therefore, having idiopathic sleep related non-obstructive alveolar hypoventilation does not necessarily mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic hypercapnia,4325865,False,"No, chronic hypercapnia is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Chronic hypercapnia refers to a condition where there is an elevated level of carbon dioxide in the blood over a prolonged period of time. While chronic hypercapnia can be seen in patients with advanced Pulmonary Hypertension due to the development of respiratory failure and impaired gas exchange, it is not a specific symptom or diagnostic criteria for Pulmonary Hypertension. Chronic hypercapnia can also be seen in other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neuromuscular disorders, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and central hypoventilation syndromes. Therefore, the presence of chronic hypercapnia does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Malignant hypertensive heart AND renal disease,442603,False,"No, the condition ""Malignant hypertensive heart AND renal disease"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

""Malignant hypertensive heart AND renal disease"" refers to a severe form of hypertension that affects both the heart and kidneys, leading to organ damage and dysfunction. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While both conditions involve elevated blood pressure, they affect different organ systems and have distinct underlying mechanisms. Therefore, having ""Malignant hypertensive heart AND renal disease"" does not necessarily mean that an individual also has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Saddle embolus of pulmonary artery,36713113,True,"Yes, a saddle embolus of the pulmonary artery is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

A saddle embolus of the pulmonary artery refers to a large blood clot that straddles the main pulmonary artery, obstructing blood flow to both lungs. This condition can lead to acute right heart strain and potentially right heart failure, which are characteristic features of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has a saddle embolus of the pulmonary artery, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension."
Interstitial keratitis,439808,False,"No

Rationale: Interstitial keratitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the cornea's middle layer, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or trauma. While interstitial keratitis can be associated with certain conditions like syphilis or autoimmune diseases, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having interstitial keratitis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Malignant hypertensive heart disease with congestive heart failure,316994,True,"Yes, the condition of malignant hypertensive heart disease with congestive heart failure is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Rationale:
- Malignant hypertensive heart disease refers to severe high blood pressure that has caused damage to the heart, leading to heart failure. Pulmonary Hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, ultimately leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has malignant hypertensive heart disease with congestive heart failure, they definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Pulmonary artery stenosis,4317288,True,"Yes, pulmonary artery stenosis is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary artery stenosis refers to a narrowing of the pulmonary artery, which can lead to increased pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. This increased pressure can contribute to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a person has pulmonary artery stenosis, they may develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a result of this condition."
Hypertensive heart and renal disease with renal failure,439695,False,"No, the condition ""Hypertensive heart and renal disease with renal failure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension specifically refers to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The condition provided refers to hypertension affecting the heart and kidneys with renal failure, which is more related to systemic hypertension affecting the heart and kidneys rather than the pulmonary vasculature. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as heart failure, the specific pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria for Pulmonary Hypertension are not met by the condition provided."
Chronic idiopathic constipation,4306923,False,"No, chronic idiopathic constipation is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While constipation can be a symptom of various medical conditions, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. In the context of PH, symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and signs of right heart failure are more indicative of the condition. Therefore, having chronic idiopathic constipation does not necessarily mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute lower respiratory infection,4110056,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute lower respiratory infection is a specific condition that involves a combination of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis) and an acute lower respiratory infection (such as pneumonia or bronchitis). While patients with COPD are at an increased risk for developing pulmonary hypertension due to chronic lung disease, having COPD with an acute lower respiratory infection does not definitively mean that the patient has pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a separate condition that requires specific diagnostic criteria, including right heart catheterization to confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, the presence of COPD with acute lower respiratory infection does not necessarily indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Dilatation of pulmonary artery,4353837,False,"No, dilatation of the pulmonary artery is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While dilatation of the pulmonary artery can be a feature of Pulmonary Hypertension, it can also be seen in other conditions such as chronic lung diseases, congenital heart defects, or even as a normal variant in some individuals. Therefore, having dilatation of the pulmonary artery does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation, such as right heart catheterization, would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Arteriovenous fistula of pulmonary vessels,441593,True,"Yes, arteriovenous fistula of pulmonary vessels is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Arteriovenous fistula of pulmonary vessels refers to an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein in the lungs, which can lead to increased blood flow and pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. This increased blood flow and pressure can contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has an arteriovenous fistula of pulmonary vessels, they would definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Disorder of episclera,4228447,False,"No, a disorder of the episclera is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Episcleritis is an inflammatory condition affecting the episclera, which is the thin, transparent layer covering the white part of the eye. It is typically characterized by redness, irritation, and discomfort in the affected eye. While episcleritis can be associated with certain systemic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, it is not directly linked to Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having a disorder of the episclera does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acquired cardiac septal defect,4108950,False,"No, an acquired cardiac septal defect is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and potentially heart failure, an acquired cardiac septal defect refers to a hole in the heart's septum that separates the chambers of the heart. This defect can lead to a variety of complications, but it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having an acquired cardiac septal defect does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Corneal stromal degeneration,4171880,False,"No

Rationale: Corneal stromal degeneration is a condition affecting the cornea of the eye, which is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbidities or conditions, corneal stromal degeneration is not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Septic pulmonary embolism,40479606,False,"No, septic pulmonary embolism is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Septic pulmonary embolism is a condition characterized by infected emboli in the pulmonary vasculature, often originating from a distant source of infection such as endocarditis or intravenous drug use. While pulmonary embolism can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all cases of septic pulmonary embolism will result in pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having septic pulmonary embolism does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary thrombosis,4239826,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary thrombosis refers to the formation of blood clots within the pulmonary vasculature. While pulmonary thrombosis can lead to pulmonary hypertension in some cases, it is not specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can have various causes, including but not limited to pulmonary thrombosis. Therefore, having pulmonary thrombosis does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Lymphangiomyomatosis of connective tissue,37016194,False,"No, lymphangiomyomatosis of connective tissue is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease characterized by the abnormal growth of smooth muscle cells in the lungs, leading to the formation of cysts and progressive respiratory symptoms. While LAM can be associated with pulmonary hypertension in some cases, it is not a defining feature of the condition. Therefore, having lymphangiomyomatosis of connective tissue does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of lung,257825,True,"Yes, a neoplasm of uncertain behavior of the lung can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Rationale: Pulmonary hypertension can be associated with various underlying conditions, including neoplasms of the lung. Tumors in the lung can lead to pulmonary hypertension through mechanisms such as compression of pulmonary vessels, obstruction of blood flow, or release of vasoactive substances. Therefore, if a patient has a neoplasm of uncertain behavior in the lung, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of the tumor, making this condition specific to the malady."
Postpartum cardiomyopathy,312383,True,"Yes, postpartum cardiomyopathy is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Postpartum cardiomyopathy is a rare form of heart failure that occurs in women during the last month of pregnancy or up to five months after giving birth. It is characterized by the weakening of the heart muscle, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the legs, and difficulty breathing when lying down. 

In the case of postpartum cardiomyopathy, the weakened heart muscle can lead to right ventricular dysfunction, which can ultimately result in pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has postpartum cardiomyopathy, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their condition. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have postpartum cardiomyopathy, as there are various other causes of pulmonary hypertension as mentioned in the description of the malady."
Polyneuropathy in collagen vascular disease,375260,False,"No.

Polyneuropathy in collagen vascular disease is a condition that involves damage to multiple peripheral nerves, often associated with autoimmune disorders such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or scleroderma. While collagen vascular diseases can be associated with pulmonary hypertension, the presence of polyneuropathy alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having polyneuropathy in collagen vascular disease does not specifically mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Angiomatosis,4006951,False,"No, angiomatosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Angiomatosis refers to a condition characterized by the presence of multiple small blood vessel tumors (angiomas) in various organs of the body. While angiomatosis can occur in the lungs and potentially contribute to pulmonary hypertension in some cases, it is not a defining or specific feature of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which is not directly related to the presence of angiomas in other organs. Therefore, having angiomatosis does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic hypersomnia,43531627,False,"No, idiopathic hypersomnia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hypersomnia is a neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, long sleep duration, and difficulty waking up. It is not directly related to the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature seen in pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience fatigue and sleep disturbances, idiopathic hypersomnia is a separate condition with its own distinct diagnostic criteria and management."
Idiopathic acute pancreatitis,4340960,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic acute pancreatitis is a condition involving inflammation of the pancreas of unknown cause. While it is possible for a patient with idiopathic acute pancreatitis to also have pulmonary hypertension, the presence of idiopathic acute pancreatitis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a separate condition with its own distinct etiology and diagnostic criteria."
Idiopathic stabbing headache,374922,False,"No, idiopathic stabbing headache is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Idiopathic stabbing headache, also known as primary stabbing headache or ice pick headache, is a type of headache characterized by short, sharp, stabbing pains in the head. It is typically a benign and self-limited condition, with no known underlying cause. While headaches can be a symptom of Pulmonary Hypertension due to decreased oxygen levels and increased pressure in the blood vessels, idiopathic stabbing headache is not a defining symptom of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic stabbing headache does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."

Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis is a rare condition characterized by recurrent episodes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, leading to the accumulation of iron in the lungs. While idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis is a distinct condition, it has been reported to be associated with pulmonary hypertension in some cases. The presence of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis may suggest an underlying pulmonary vascular disease, such as pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, they may also have pulmonary hypertension."
Congenital central hypoventilation,319793,True,"Yes, congenital central hypoventilation is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare disorder characterized by a decrease in the drive to breathe, leading to inadequate ventilation, especially during sleep. This can result in low oxygen levels and high carbon dioxide levels in the blood. Patients with CCHS may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of chronic hypoventilation, which can lead to right heart dysfunction and heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has congenital central hypoventilation, they are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension. On the other hand, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have congenital central hypoventilation, as there are multiple other causes and risk factors for the development of PH."
Dextrocardia,4100815,False,"No, dextrocardia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Dextrocardia is a rare congenital condition where the heart is located on the right side of the chest instead of the left.

Pulmonary blood vessel injury,440260,True,"Yes, pulmonary blood vessel injury is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which can result from various etiologies including pulmonary blood vessel injury. Injuries to the pulmonary blood vessels can lead to increased resistance in the pulmonary circulation, contributing to the development of PH. Therefore, if a person has pulmonary blood vessel injury, they may develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a result."
Saddle embolus of pulmonary artery with acute cor pulmonale,35615055,True,"Yes, the condition ""Saddle embolus of pulmonary artery with acute cor pulmonale"" is specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension. 

The presence of a saddle embolus in the pulmonary artery indicates a significant obstruction in the pulmonary vasculature, which can lead to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and right ventricular dysfunction, ultimately resulting in acute cor pulmonale. This condition is a manifestation of severe pulmonary hypertension, as the increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries can lead to acute right heart failure. Therefore, if a patient presents with a saddle embolus in the pulmonary artery and acute cor pulmonale, they definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Familial non-neuropathic amyloidosis,4030362,True,"Yes, familial non-neuropathic amyloidosis is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Familial non-neuropathic amyloidosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the abnormal deposition of amyloid protein in various tissues and organs, including the heart and lungs. In some cases, amyloid deposition in the heart can lead to restrictive cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has familial non-neuropathic amyloidosis, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of the disease. However, not all cases of pulmonary hypertension are caused by familial non-neuropathic amyloidosis, as there are various other etiologies for PH as mentioned in the description of the malady."

While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, primary alveolar hypoventilation is a distinct condition with its own set of symptoms and underlying pathophysiology. Therefore, having primary alveolar hypoventilation does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary vein dilatation,40491522,False,"No, pulmonary vein dilatation is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary vein dilatation refers to the enlargement of the pulmonary veins, which can be seen on imaging studies such as CT scans or MRIs. While pulmonary vein dilatation can be a finding in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, it is not a definitive indicator of the condition. Pulmonary vein dilatation can also be seen in other conditions such as left heart failure, pulmonary venous hypertension, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, the presence of pulmonary vein dilatation alone does not confirm the diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Sepsis-associated left ventricular failure,4079695,False,"No.

Rationale:
Sepsis-associated left ventricular failure is a condition that specifically refers to left ventricular dysfunction or failure that occurs as a complication of sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to infection. While sepsis can lead to various cardiovascular complications, including left ventricular failure, it is not a specific symptom or characteristic of pulmonary hypertension.

Therefore, having idiopathic maternal thrombocytopenia does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic idiopathic monocytosis,4329853,False,"No, chronic idiopathic monocytosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic idiopathic monocytosis refers to a condition characterized by persistently elevated levels of monocytes in the blood without an identifiable cause. While chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation may be associated with pulmonary hypertension, chronic idiopathic monocytosis is not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having chronic idiopathic monocytosis does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic hyperaldosteronism,4122996,False,"No.

Rationale: Idiopathic hyperaldosteronism is a condition characterized by overproduction of aldosterone by the adrenal glands, leading to hypertension and low potassium levels. While hypertension is a common symptom in both idiopathic hyperaldosteronism and pulmonary hypertension, the specific pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria for each condition are distinct. Pulmonary hypertension is defined by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, whereas idiopathic hyperaldosteronism involves excess aldosterone production. Therefore, having idiopathic hyperaldosteronism does not necessarily mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."
Dependence on nocturnal oxygen therapy,46273422,True,"Yes, dependence on nocturnal oxygen therapy can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop hypoxemia due to impaired gas exchange in the lungs, leading to a decreased oxygen saturation in the blood. This can result in the need for supplemental oxygen therapy, especially during sleep when respiratory function may be further compromised. Dependence on nocturnal oxygen therapy can be a sign of advanced Pulmonary Hypertension and right heart failure, as the body struggles to maintain adequate oxygen levels. Therefore, if a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension is dependent on nocturnal oxygen therapy, it is highly likely that they have the malady."
Familial temporal lobe epilepsy,37204833,False,"No, familial temporal lobe epilepsy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial temporal lobe epilepsy is a type of epilepsy that runs in families and is characterized by seizures originating in the temporal lobes of the brain.

Rationale:
Adult familial nephronophthisis with spastic quadriparesia syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by kidney disease (nephronophthisis) and spastic quadriparesis (muscle weakness and stiffness in all four limbs). This condition does not have a direct association with pulmonary hypertension. While patients with nephronophthisis may have other systemic manifestations, there is no known direct link between this condition and the development of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having adult familial nephronophthisis with spastic quadriparesia syndrome does not necessarily mean that an individual will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Infection of uncertain etiology,4327875,False,"No, an infection of uncertain etiology is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While infections can potentially contribute to the development or exacerbation of PH, they are not a defining characteristic of the condition.

Additional diagnostic testing, such as echocardiography and right heart catheterization, would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Primary idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy,4274635,True,"Yes, primary idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Primary idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy is a specific type of heart muscle disease characterized by stiffening of the heart muscle, leading to impaired filling of the ventricles and reduced cardiac output. In the context of pulmonary hypertension, the right ventricle may become enlarged and dysfunctional due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. This can lead to right heart failure, which is a common complication of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has primary idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of the underlying heart condition."
Rheumatic left ventricular failure,4184497,False,"No, rheumatic left ventricular failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Rheumatic left ventricular failure refers to heart failure specifically affecting the left side of the heart due to rheumatic heart disease, which is a condition caused by untreated streptococcal infections.

Patients who have undergone a Fontan operation, which is a surgical procedure used to treat certain types of congenital heart defects, are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension as a complication. The Fontan operation alters the normal circulation of blood in the heart, leading to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature over time. This can eventually result in right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which are characteristic features of Pulmonary Hypertension.

Therefore, if a patient has the condition of low output heart failure due to and following Fontan operation, they definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic syringomyelia,37110685,False,"No, idiopathic syringomyelia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic syringomyelia is a condition characterized by the development of a fluid-filled cyst (syrinx) within the spinal cord, leading to symptoms such as pain, weakness, and sensory abnormalities. It is not directly related to the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature seen in pulmonary hypertension. While patients with idiopathic syringomyelia may have other comorbidities, there is no direct causal relationship between these two conditions."
Polyneuropathy co-occurrent and due to systemic connective tissue disorder,37110682,True,"Yes, polyneuropathy co-occurrent and due to systemic connective tissue disorder can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Polyneuropathy is a condition that involves damage to multiple peripheral nerves, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain in the extremities. In the context of a systemic connective tissue disorder, such as systemic sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus, polyneuropathy can occur as a result of autoimmune-mediated nerve damage.

In patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, especially those with connective tissue disorders as an underlying cause, polyneuropathy can be a manifestation of the systemic nature of the disease. Connective tissue disorders can affect multiple organ systems, including the nervous system, leading to conditions like polyneuropathy.

Therefore, if a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension also has polyneuropathy co-occurrent and due to a systemic connective tissue disorder, it is likely that the polyneuropathy is specific to the Pulmonary Hypertension in this case."
"Atrioventricular septal defect, blepharophimosis, radial and anal defect syndrome",35621810,True,"Yes, the condition ""Atrioventricular septal defect, blepharophimosis, radial and anal defect syndrome"" is specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Atrioventricular septal defect, blepharophimosis, radial and anal defect syndrome, also known as ARS, is a rare genetic disorder that is associated with pulmonary hypertension. Patients with ARS may have congenital heart defects such as atrioventricular septal defects, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension due to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, if an individual has ARS, they are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have ARS, as there are various other causes and risk factors for the development of this condition."
Familial cervical artery dissection,36680605,False,"No, familial cervical artery dissection is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial cervical artery dissection refers to a condition where there is a tear in one of the arteries in the neck, leading to a disruption in blood flow. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While both conditions can have cardiovascular implications, they are distinct entities with different underlying mechanisms."
Idiopathic uveal effusion syndrome,36680601,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic uveal effusion syndrome is a condition characterized by serous detachment of the choroid and ciliary body, leading to exudative retinal detachment and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. This condition primarily affects the eyes and is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. While there may be systemic conditions associated with uveal effusion syndrome, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Double outlet right ventricle with subaortic ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis Fallot type,3656079,True,"Yes, the condition of double outlet right ventricle with subaortic ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis Fallot type is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

This specific condition involves structural abnormalities in the heart that can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, ultimately contributing to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. The presence of pulmonary stenosis and ventricular septal defect can cause increased resistance in the pulmonary circulation, leading to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Therefore, if a patient has this specific condition, they are likely to develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a result of the underlying cardiac abnormalities."
Idiopathic mid-dermal elastolysis,4032900,False,"No, idiopathic mid-dermal elastolysis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic mid-dermal elastolysis is a rare skin condition characterized by the selective loss of elastic tissue in the mid-dermis, leading to skin wrinkling and atrophy. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbidities or conditions, idiopathic mid-dermal elastolysis is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic achalasia of esophagus,37399429,False,"No, idiopathic achalasia of the esophagus is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Idiopathic achalasia of the esophagus is a rare esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and absent peristalsis in the esophageal body. It typically presents with symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss. While there have been reports of an association between achalasia and pulmonary hypertension, the two conditions are not directly linked in a way that having one definitively means having the other. Pulmonary hypertension is more commonly associated with conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, and chronic lung diseases. Therefore, the presence of idiopathic achalasia of the esophagus does not necessarily indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Familial Alzheimer-like prion disease,36717455,False,"No, Familial Alzheimer-like prion disease is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Familial Alzheimer-like prion disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive neurological deterioration, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes due to the accumulation of abnormal prion proteins in the brain. It is not related to the pathophysiology or etiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, and the symptoms and diagnostic criteria for these two conditions are distinct. Therefore, having Familial Alzheimer-like prion disease does not necessarily mean that a person will also have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Right ventricular aneurysm,40483752,False,"No

Rationale: While right ventricular dysfunction is a common complication of pulmonary hypertension, a right ventricular aneurysm is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Right ventricular aneurysms can be caused by various factors such as myocardial infarction, trauma, or congenital heart defects. Therefore, having a right ventricular aneurysm does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Familial idiopathic dilatation of right atrium,37399551,False,"No, familial idiopathic dilatation of the right atrium is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While both conditions can be associated with heart dysfunction, they are not directly correlated. Familial idiopathic dilatation of the right atrium refers to an enlargement of the right atrium of the heart that is of unknown cause and may have a genetic component. It is a separate entity from pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having familial idiopathic dilatation of the right atrium does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Decompensated chronic heart failure,4311437,False,"No

Rationale: While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, decompensated chronic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Decompensated chronic heart failure can be caused by various underlying conditions, not just pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, decompensated chronic heart failure can result from left heart disease, which is an exclusion for pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having decompensated chronic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Familial developmental dysphasia,36715517,False,"No, familial developmental dysphasia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial developmental dysphasia refers to a specific language disorder that runs in families and is characterized by difficulties in language development. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension or its associated symptoms."

Idiopathic adductor spastic dysphonia is a neurological condition characterized by involuntary spasms of the vocal cords, leading to strained and strangled speech. It is not directly related to the cardiovascular system or pulmonary vasculature dysfunction, which are the hallmarks of pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, they would not typically present with symptoms related to vocal cord dysfunction. Therefore, having idiopathic adductor spastic dysphonia does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Familial Alzheimer's disease of early onset,4043241,True,"Yes, Familial Alzheimer's disease of early onset is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Familial Alzheimer's disease of early onset is a genetic condition that causes the development of Alzheimer's disease at a younger age, typically before the age of 65. There is no known direct link between Familial Alzheimer's disease of early onset and Pulmonary Hypertension. These two conditions affect different systems in the body (neurological system for Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular system for Pulmonary Hypertension) and have distinct etiologies. Therefore, having Familial Alzheimer's disease of early onset does not necessarily mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Familial hypodontia,4033001,False,"No, familial hypodontia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial hypodontia is a genetic condition characterized by the absence of one or more teeth, which is not directly related to the cardiovascular system or pulmonary vasculature. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may also have familial hypodontia, the presence of familial hypodontia does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Corneal stromal edema,4159968,False,"No

Rationale: Corneal stromal edema is a condition affecting the cornea of the eye, characterized by swelling of the corneal stroma due to fluid accumulation. While corneal stromal edema is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, it may be seen in patients with systemic conditions that affect fluid balance, such as heart failure. However, the presence of corneal stromal edema alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in a patient presenting with corneal stromal edema."
Idiopathic glomerular disease,36715483,False,"No, idiopathic glomerular disease is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic glomerular disease refers to a group of kidney disorders affecting the glomeruli, which are the filtering units of the kidneys. While there may be some overlap in patients with both conditions due to underlying systemic diseases, having idiopathic glomerular disease does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. It is important to evaluate each condition separately and consider other potential causes for the symptoms presented."
Idiopathic premature ovarian failure,36715484,False,"No, idiopathic premature ovarian failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic premature ovarian failure is a condition characterized by the loss of normal ovarian function before the age of 40, leading to infertility and hormonal imbalances. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. While both conditions may have underlying genetic factors, they are distinct entities with different clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria."
Idiopathic acute tubulointerstitial nephritis,4188623,False,"No, idiopathic acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Idiopathic acute tubulointerstitial nephritis refers to inflammation of the renal tubules and interstitium of the kidney of unknown cause. This condition primarily affects the kidneys and is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension.

Additional evaluation and testing would be necessary to determine if a patient with idiopathic acute tubulointerstitial nephritis also has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic gynecomastia,4331956,False,"No, idiopathic gynecomastia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic gynecomastia refers to the benign enlargement of male breast tissue, which can be caused by hormonal imbalances, medications, or other underlying conditions. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with various etiologies, there is no direct link between idiopathic gynecomastia and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic gynecomastia does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Congestive heart failure due to cardiomyopathy,44782428,True,"Yes, congestive heart failure due to cardiomyopathy is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Congestive heart failure due to cardiomyopathy can lead to right ventricular dysfunction, which is a common complication of pulmonary hypertension. In pulmonary hypertension, elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has congestive heart failure due to cardiomyopathy, they may also have pulmonary hypertension as a result of the right ventricular dysfunction."
Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy,45765443,False,"No.

Rationale:
Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy is a condition characterized by muscle weakness and inflammation of the muscles. While it can present with symptoms such as fatigue and weakness, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. These two conditions have different pathophysiological mechanisms and do not necessarily co-occur. Therefore, having idiopathic inflammatory myopathy does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis,4219458,False,"No, idiopathic chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Idiopathic chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis is a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the tubules and interstitium of the kidneys, leading to impaired kidney function. This condition primarily affects the kidneys and does not directly involve the pulmonary vasculature or right ventricular dysfunction, which are key features of pulmonary hypertension. While patients with chronic kidney disease may develop secondary pulmonary hypertension due to complications such as volume overload and heart failure, the presence of idiopathic chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in a patient with chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis."
Idiopathic diffuse ulcerative nongranulomatous enteritis,4231748,False,"No, the condition ""Idiopathic diffuse ulcerative nongranulomatous enteritis"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

While both conditions can be serious and require medical attention, they are distinct entities with different pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical presentations."
Pulmonary trunk present,40487008,False,"No

Rationale: The presence of a pulmonary trunk is a normal anatomical structure in the cardiovascular system and is not specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, the presence of a pulmonary trunk alone does not indicate the presence of this condition."
Segmental progressive overgrowth syndrome with fibroadipose hyperplasia,37204025,True,"Yes

Rationale: The condition described, segmental progressive overgrowth syndrome with fibroadipose hyperplasia, is a specific and unique condition that is not typically associated with pulmonary hypertension. While patients with this condition may have various physical manifestations related to overgrowth and fibroadipose hyperplasia, there is no known direct link between this condition and the development of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having this condition does not necessarily mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic hypercalcemia,4098605,False,"No, idiopathic hypercalcemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hypercalcemia refers to elevated levels of calcium in the blood without a known cause. While hypercalcemia can occur in various conditions, it is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is based on specific hemodynamic criteria and clinical presentation, rather than calcium levels in the blood. Therefore, having idiopathic hypercalcemia does not necessarily mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Systolic heart failure stage C,43020421,True,"Yes, systolic heart failure stage C is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Systolic heart failure stage C is a condition that is characterized by structural heart disease and symptoms of heart failure, such as dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention. In the case of pulmonary hypertension, the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has systolic heart failure stage C, they may have developed this condition as a result of pulmonary hypertension. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will necessarily develop systolic heart failure stage C, as there are various etiologies and factors that can contribute to the progression of the disease."
Idiopathic erosion of teeth,4102678,False,"No, idiopathic erosion of teeth is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Idiopathic erosion of teeth refers to the wearing away of tooth enamel without a specific known cause.

While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other skin manifestations, idiopathic benign cutaneous mucinosis is not a known associated condition with pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiac insufficiency as a complication of care,4153875,False,"No, cardiac insufficiency as a complication of care is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, cardiac insufficiency as a complication of care can be caused by a variety of other factors such as myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having cardiac insufficiency as a complication of care does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Cardiorenal syndrome,40482857,False,"No

Rationale: Cardiorenal syndrome is a condition characterized by the simultaneous dysfunction of both the heart and kidneys, leading to a complex interplay between the two organ systems. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, it is not specifically linked to renal dysfunction in the definition or description provided. Therefore, having cardiorenal syndrome does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Failure of growth of fetal right cardiac ventricle,43020509,False,"No, the condition ""Failure of growth of fetal right cardiac ventricle"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction, the failure of growth of the fetal right cardiac ventricle is a specific developmental issue related to the heart during fetal development. It is not a direct symptom or diagnostic criteria for Pulmonary Hypertension."
Familial benign copper deficiency,35608648,False,"No, familial benign copper deficiency is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial benign copper deficiency is a rare genetic condition characterized by low levels of copper in the body, leading to various symptoms such as anemia, neutropenia, and neurological abnormalities. While copper deficiency can have systemic effects, it is not directly linked to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having familial benign copper deficiency does not necessarily mean that an individual will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic hemolytic anemia,45768941,False,"No

Rationale:
Chronic hemolytic anemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While chronic hemolytic anemia can be a comorbidity or associated condition in some cases of pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, as described in the provided description. Therefore, having chronic hemolytic anemia does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,4270625,False,"No, primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While both conditions can lead to heart failure, they are distinct entities with different underlying pathophysiology. Primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, particularly the left ventricle, leading to impaired heart function. In contrast, pulmonary hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the presence of primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic congenital megacolon,4147792,False,"No, idiopathic congenital megacolon is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic congenital megacolon, also known as Hirschsprung's disease, is a congenital condition characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, leading to functional obstruction and symptoms such as constipation, abdominal distension, and failure to pass meconium in the neonatal period. It is a separate and distinct condition from pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may have other underlying conditions, including congenital heart defects, idiopathic congenital megacolon is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary capillaritis,45768905,False,"No, pulmonary capillaritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary capillaritis is a rare condition characterized by inflammation of the pulmonary capillaries, leading to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and respiratory symptoms. While pulmonary capillaritis can be associated with connective tissue diseases, it is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. Patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other pulmonary complications, but the presence of pulmonary capillaritis alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Familial idiopathic hypercalciuria,4035146,False,"No, familial idiopathic hypercalciuria is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial idiopathic hypercalciuria is a genetic condition characterized by excessive calcium excretion in the urine, which can lead to kidney stones and other renal complications. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as fatigue or chest pain, familial idiopathic hypercalciuria is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having familial idiopathic hypercalciuria does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Heart failure with normal ejection fraction,40486933,False,"No, heart failure with normal ejection fraction is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, heart failure with normal ejection fraction can have various causes, including hypertension, valvular heart disease, and myocardial disease.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis due to tuberous sclerosis syndrome,45768902,True,"Yes, the condition of Lymphangioleiomyomatosis due to tuberous sclerosis syndrome is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease that can occur in individuals with tuberous sclerosis syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that can also affect other organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys, and skin. LAM can lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension as a complication, due to the progressive nature of the disease causing damage to the lung tissue and blood vessels. Therefore, if a patient has Lymphangioleiomyomatosis due to tuberous sclerosis syndrome, they are at risk for developing Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic hypochromic anemia,4098627,False,"No, idiopathic hypochromic anemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hypochromic anemia is a type of anemia characterized by low levels of hemoglobin and small, pale red blood cells of unknown cause. While anemia can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension due to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Therefore, having idiopathic hypochromic anemia does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic exfoliative cheilitis,45768747,False,"No.

Rationale: Idiopathic exfoliative cheilitis is a condition characterized by continuous peeling of the lips, often with unknown etiology. While this condition may cause discomfort and cosmetic concerns, it is not specifically associated with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic exfoliative cheilitis does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic portal hypertension,36716711,False,"No, idiopathic portal hypertension is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic portal hypertension is a condition characterized by increased pressure in the portal vein without an identifiable cause. It primarily affects the liver and can lead to complications such as variceal bleeding and ascites. While both conditions involve increased pressure in the vasculature, they affect different systems (portal vein vs. pulmonary vasculature) and have distinct etiologies and clinical presentations. Therefore, having idiopathic portal hypertension does not necessarily mean that a person also has pulmonary hypertension."
Hypertrophy of septomarginal trabeculation,4235995,False,"No, hypertrophy of septomarginal trabeculation is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Hypertrophy of septomarginal trabeculation refers to an anatomical variation in the heart where there is an increase in the size of a specific muscular structure within the right ventricle. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension may have hypertrophy of septomarginal trabeculation as a coincidental finding, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Dependence on continuous supplemental oxygen,46270565,True,"Yes, dependence on continuous supplemental oxygen can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop severe symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue due to the elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately, heart failure. As the disease progresses, patients may require continuous supplemental oxygen to help with their breathing and oxygenation. Therefore, if a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension is dependent on continuous supplemental oxygen, it is highly likely that they have the malady. 

However, it is important to note that not all patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may require continuous supplemental oxygen, as the severity of the disease can vary among individuals."
Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation not Brugada type,37109917,False,"No, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation not Brugada type is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation refers to a condition where there is an abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction.

While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may have underlying heart conditions that could potentially lead to ventricular fibrillation, the presence of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation not Brugada type does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic testing and evaluation would be necessary to determine if there is a connection between the two conditions."

Therefore, having Haddad syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Familial non-obstructive reflux-associated chronic pyelonephritis,45768718,False,"No, familial non-obstructive reflux-associated chronic pyelonephritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Familial non-obstructive reflux-associated chronic pyelonephritis is a condition involving chronic inflammation of the kidneys due to abnormal backward flow of urine from the bladder to the kidneys. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbid conditions, familial non-obstructive reflux-associated chronic pyelonephritis is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension."
Isolated idiopathic granuloma of stomach,4078219,False,"No

Rationale: The condition of isolated idiopathic granuloma of the stomach is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

These two conditions are distinct entities with different pathophysiological mechanisms and diagnostic criteria."
Rupture of pulmonary vessel,4221695,False,"No, the condition ""Rupture of pulmonary vessel"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, a rupture of a pulmonary vessel is a separate event that can occur due to various causes such as trauma, pulmonary embolism, or underlying vascular abnormalities. While a rupture of a pulmonary vessel can potentially lead to complications such as pulmonary hemorrhage, it is not a defining characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Stricture of pulmonary vessel,4035327,False,"No, a stricture of a pulmonary vessel is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, a stricture of a pulmonary vessel refers to a narrowing or constriction of the vessel itself. This narrowing can be caused by various factors such as inflammation, scarring, or external compression, and may not necessarily lead to the hemodynamic changes characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, the presence of a stricture of a pulmonary vessel does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic hyperprolactinemia,4129528,False,"No, idiopathic hyperprolactinemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hyperprolactinemia refers to elevated levels of the hormone prolactin in the blood without a known cause.

The two conditions are distinct entities with different pathophysiological mechanisms and diagnostic criteria."
Primary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy,4203149,True,"Yes, primary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Primary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition characterized by the dilation and impaired contraction of the left ventricle of the heart, leading to heart failure. Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication of dilated cardiomyopathy, as the dysfunction of the left ventricle can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, if a patient has primary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of their underlying heart condition. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have dilated cardiomyopathy, as there are various other causes of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure."
Familial MÃ©niÃ¨re disease,36716772,False,"No, Familial Ménière disease is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Familial Ménière disease is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and a sensation of fullness in the ear.

There is no known direct association between Familial Ménière disease and Pulmonary Hypertension based on current medical knowledge."
Acute right-sided congestive heart failure,4215446,True,"Yes, acute right-sided congestive heart failure is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Acute right-sided congestive heart failure is a common complication of pulmonary hypertension. As pulmonary hypertension progresses, the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately right-sided heart failure. Therefore, if a patient presents with acute right-sided congestive heart failure, it is highly likely that they have pulmonary hypertension as the underlying cause."
Erythroderma of unknown etiology,4270742,False,"No, erythroderma of unknown etiology is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Erythroderma is a generalized redness of the skin that can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, including drug reactions, infections, inflammatory skin diseases, and malignancies.

While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have skin manifestations, erythroderma alone is not sufficient to diagnose or indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic megacolon,4057830,False,"No, idiopathic megacolon is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic megacolon, also known as Hirschsprung's disease, is a congenital condition characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the colon, leading to functional obstruction and severe constipation. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbidities, including gastrointestinal conditions like idiopathic megacolon, the presence of idiopathic megacolon does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Tortuosity of pulmonary artery,40487093,False,"No, tortuosity of the pulmonary artery is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While tortuosity of the pulmonary artery may be seen in some cases of Pulmonary Hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, as assessed by right heart catheterization. Therefore, the presence of tortuosity of the pulmonary artery alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation and assessment of hemodynamics would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypoperfusion of right pulmonary artery due to preferential flow to left pulmonary artery,40487095,False,"No, the condition ""Hypoperfusion of right pulmonary artery due to preferential flow to left pulmonary artery"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to changes in pulmonary blood flow and perfusion, the specific condition described does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Other factors such as congenital heart defects or pulmonary embolism could also result in preferential flow to one pulmonary artery over the other. Therefore, the presence of this condition does not necessarily mean the individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Hypoperfusion of left pulmonary artery due to preferential flow to right pulmonary artery,40487094,False,"No.

The condition described, hypoperfusion of the left pulmonary artery due to preferential flow to the right pulmonary artery, does not specifically indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, the specific condition mentioned does not directly correlate with the diagnostic criteria for PH, which involves an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest, as assessed by right heart catheterization. Additionally, the condition described does not encompass the full spectrum of symptoms and signs associated with PH, such as right heart dysfunction and heart failure. Therefore, the presence of the condition does not definitively indicate the presence of PH."

Therefore, having idiopathic postprandial hypoglycemia does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Neonatal cardiac failure due to decreased left ventricular output,36716748,False,"No. Neonatal cardiac failure due to decreased left ventricular output is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, neonatal cardiac failure due to decreased left ventricular output is more indicative of issues with the left side of the heart rather than the pulmonary vasculature. This condition may be caused by various factors such as congenital heart defects, infections, or metabolic disorders, which are different from the etiologies of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having neonatal cardiac failure due to decreased left ventricular output does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic gastric stasis,4227773,False,"No, idiopathic gastric stasis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic gastric stasis refers to delayed emptying of the stomach without an identifiable cause. While gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, nausea, and vomiting can occur in patients with pulmonary hypertension due to right heart failure, idiopathic gastric stasis is not a defining feature of the condition.

Congestive heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction,4139864,False,"No, congestive heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, congestive heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction is a separate condition that primarily affects the left side of the heart. It is important to differentiate between the two conditions as they have different underlying causes and treatment approaches."
Dilatation of common atrioventricular valve annulus,4102994,False,"No, the condition ""Dilatation of common atrioventricular valve annulus"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While it may be seen in some patients with PH as a result of right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having dilatation of the common atrioventricular valve annulus does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Familial porphyria cutanea tarda,4244271,False,"No.

Rationale:
Familial porphyria cutanea tarda is a genetic disorder that affects the skin and liver, leading to the accumulation of porphyrins in the body.

Solitary pulmonary trunk with aortic atresia,4101014,True,"Yes, the condition of solitary pulmonary trunk with aortic atresia is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

In the case of solitary pulmonary trunk with aortic atresia, there is a single pulmonary artery arising from the heart, which can lead to increased pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. This abnormality can contribute to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension, as the elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which are characteristic features of PH.

Therefore, if a patient has the condition of solitary pulmonary trunk with aortic atresia, they would definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic nystagmus,762786,False,"No, idiopathic nystagmus is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic nystagmus refers to involuntary, rhythmic eye movements that occur without an identifiable cause. While nystagmus can be associated with certain neurological conditions or inner ear disorders, it is not a known symptom or sign of pulmonary hypertension.

The two conditions have different pathophysiologies and diagnostic criteria, so having chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura does not necessarily mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
Familial abdominal aortic aneurysm,37398919,False,"No.

Rationale:
Familial abdominal aortic aneurysm is a condition that specifically refers to the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysms within a family, suggesting a genetic predisposition to developing this condition. While abdominal aortic aneurysms can lead to complications such as rupture and potentially affect blood flow to various organs, it is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension specifically involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, which is not a characteristic of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Therefore, having familial abdominal aortic aneurysm does not necessarily mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."

Pulmonary Hypertension is just one potential cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, but it is not the only cause. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to determine if Pulmonary Hypertension is the underlying cause in this specific case."
Calcification of pulmonary valve annulus,43020625,False,"No, calcification of the pulmonary valve annulus is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While calcification of the pulmonary valve annulus may be seen in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, as well as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure as assessed by right heart catheterization. Therefore, the presence of calcification of the pulmonary valve annulus alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute heart failure,764873,True,"Yes, the condition of reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute heart failure is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

In patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction can occur due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to heart failure. Reduced ejection fraction is a common finding in patients with heart failure, including those with Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute heart failure, it is highly likely that they also have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to chronic heart failure,764872,True,"Yes, the condition of reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to chronic heart failure is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. In the description of Pulmonary Hypertension, it is mentioned that PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Reduced ejection fraction is a common characteristic of heart failure, and in the context of PH, it can be a result of the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure leading to right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, if a patient has reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to chronic heart failure, they would definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute heart failure co-occurrent with normal ejection fraction,764877,False,"No, acute heart failure co-occurrent with normal ejection fraction is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right heart failure as a result of elevated pulmonary pressures, acute heart failure with normal ejection fraction can have various causes, including coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, myocarditis, or other cardiomyopathies.

Additional diagnostic evaluation would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the acute heart failure in this case."
Chronic heart failure co-occurrent with normal ejection fraction,764876,False,"No, chronic heart failure co-occurrent with normal ejection fraction is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right heart failure as a result of elevated pulmonary pressures, chronic heart failure with normal ejection fraction can have various other causes such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathies. Therefore, the presence of chronic heart failure with normal ejection fraction does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Heart failure confirmed,4215689,False,"No

Rationale: While heart failure can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension, not all patients with heart failure have pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, but heart failure can also have other causes such as coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having heart failure confirmed does not necessarily mean that the patient definitely has pulmonary hypertension."
Reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute on chronic heart failure,764871,True,"Yes, the condition of reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute on chronic heart failure is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

In the description of Pulmonary Hypertension, it is mentioned that one of the manifestations of the condition is right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Reduced ejection fraction is a common finding in heart failure, and in the context of acute on chronic heart failure, it can lead to right ventricular dysfunction. This dysfunction can contribute to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension as described in the malady. Therefore, if a patient has the condition of reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute on chronic heart failure, they may definitely have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congestive heart failure stage B due to ischemic cardiomyopathy,36712928,False,"No, congestive heart failure stage B due to ischemic cardiomyopathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of heart failure are due to pulmonary hypertension. There are various causes of heart failure, including ischemic cardiomyopathy, which is a condition where the heart muscle is weakened due to lack of blood flow and oxygen. Therefore, having congestive heart failure stage B due to ischemic cardiomyopathy does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."

Rationale: Familial adrenocortical hypoplasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the adrenal glands, leading to adrenal insufficiency. This condition does not directly relate to pulmonary hypertension, as it primarily affects the adrenal glands and hormone production rather than the pulmonary vasculature or heart function. While a patient with familial adrenocortical hypoplasia may develop other medical conditions, there is no direct correlation between this condition and pulmonary hypertension."
Systolic heart failure stage C due to ischemic cardiomyopathy,36712929,True,"Yes, the condition of systolic heart failure stage C due to ischemic cardiomyopathy is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, especially in advanced stages such as stage C systolic heart failure, are at increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. The elevated pulmonary arterial pressure in pulmonary hypertension can be a consequence of the right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure seen in patients with advanced systolic heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has systolic heart failure stage C due to ischemic cardiomyopathy, they may also have pulmonary hypertension as a result of their underlying heart condition."
Failed attempted termination of pregnancy with amniotic fluid embolism,4017134,False,"No, the condition ""Failed attempted termination of pregnancy with amniotic fluid embolism"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While amniotic fluid embolism can lead to severe complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary hypertension, not all cases of amniotic fluid embolism will result in the development of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a separate and distinct condition that can have various causes, as outlined in the description provided. Therefore, having a failed attempted termination of pregnancy with amniotic fluid embolism does not definitively mean that an individual will develop pulmonary hypertension."

Therefore, if a patient has heart failure due to end stage congenital heart disease, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension as well."
Ayerza's syndrome,4193236,True,"Yes

Rationale: Ayerza's syndrome, also known as Eisenmenger syndrome, is a specific condition that can lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension. It is a complication of certain congenital heart defects, such as ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, or patent ductus arteriosus, where there is a reversal of blood flow from the systemic circulation to the pulmonary circulation, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and ultimately pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has Ayerza's syndrome, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension as it is a direct consequence of the underlying condition."
Familial pericarditis,4252587,False,"No, familial pericarditis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial pericarditis refers to inflammation of the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart) that occurs in multiple family members, suggesting a genetic predisposition. While pericarditis can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension due to right heart strain, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, rather than inflammation of the pericardium."

Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which can result from various underlying causes as mentioned in the description of the malady. Therefore, having pulmonary vein stenosis does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Refractory heart failure,4199500,True,"Yes, refractory heart failure is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Refractory heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to meet the body's needs, leading to symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of right heart failure. In the case of pulmonary hypertension, the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has refractory heart failure, it is likely that they have pulmonary hypertension as well, as the two conditions are closely related in terms of pathophysiology and symptoms."
Hyperplasia of ovarian stroma,4146224,False,"No, hyperplasia of ovarian stroma is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Hyperplasia of ovarian stroma refers to an increase in the number of cells in the supportive tissue of the ovary, which can be associated with conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or ovarian tumors.

Therefore, having isolated familial renal hypomagnesemia does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic sideroblastic anemia,4173028,True,"Yes, idiopathic sideroblastic anemia is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Idiopathic sideroblastic anemia is a rare type of anemia characterized by the presence of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow, which are erythroblasts containing iron granules arranged around the nucleus. This condition is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension, and there is no known direct association between the two. Therefore, having idiopathic sideroblastic anemia does not necessarily mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
On optimal heart failure therapy,44811840,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""On optimal heart failure therapy"" does not specifically indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While patients with PH may ultimately develop right heart failure, being on optimal heart failure therapy could be indicative of various other cardiac conditions such as systolic or diastolic heart failure, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathies. Therefore, the presence of this condition does not definitively mean that the individual has PH."
Adenomatous hyperplasia of rete testis,4003025,False,"No, adenomatous hyperplasia of rete testis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Adenomatous hyperplasia of rete testis is a benign proliferative lesion of the rete testis, which is not related to the pulmonary vasculature or right ventricular dysfunction characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. These two conditions involve different organ systems and pathophysiological processes, making adenomatous hyperplasia of rete testis unrelated to pulmonary hypertension."

Idiopathic juxtafoveal telangiectasia is a rare retinal condition characterized by abnormal blood vessels in the macula, leading to vision loss. While both conditions can be associated with systemic diseases, they are not directly related to each other."
Tay-Sachs disease,4009170,False,"No, Tay-Sachs disease is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Tay-Sachs disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence of a vital enzyme called hexosaminidase A (Hex-A). This enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of specific fats (lipids) in the brain and nerve cells, resulting in progressive neurological deterioration. While individuals with Tay-Sachs disease may experience a variety of symptoms related to the nervous system, there is no direct association between Tay-Sachs disease and Pulmonary Hypertension. These two conditions are distinct entities with different underlying causes and pathophysiology."
Fibrosis of tunica vaginalis,4168910,False,"No, fibrosis of tunica vaginalis is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Fibrosis of tunica vaginalis refers to scarring or thickening of the tunica vaginalis, which is the outer layer covering the testis. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While both conditions may occur in the same individual, having fibrosis of tunica vaginalis does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."

Idiopathic aortitis refers to inflammation of the aorta of unknown cause, which is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. While both conditions can have overlapping symptoms such as chest pain and fatigue, they are distinct entities with different underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having idiopathic aortitis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Spiralling course of aorta and pulmonary artery,40486556,False,"No, the condition of a spiralling course of the aorta and pulmonary artery is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While abnormalities in the anatomy of the aorta and pulmonary artery can contribute to certain cardiovascular conditions, they are not a defining characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The presence of a spiralling course of the aorta and pulmonary artery would not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Right cardiac ventricular dilatation,4101317,True,"Yes, right cardiac ventricular dilatation is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

In Pulmonary Hypertension, the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately right heart failure. As a result, right cardiac ventricular dilatation can be a common finding in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension. This condition is a direct consequence of the increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, causing the right ventricle to work harder to pump blood into the pulmonary circulation. Therefore, if a patient presents with right cardiac ventricular dilatation, it is highly suggestive of Pulmonary Hypertension as the underlying cause."
Decompensated cardiac failure,4111554,False,"No, decompensated cardiac failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Decompensated cardiac failure refers to the worsening of heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention, due to the heart's inability to pump blood effectively. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, decompensated cardiac failure can be caused by various other conditions such as coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having decompensated cardiac failure does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic myoglobinuria,4207805,False,"No, idiopathic myoglobinuria is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic myoglobinuria refers to the presence of myoglobin in the urine without an identifiable cause, which can be due to various conditions such as muscle injury, metabolic disorders, or genetic conditions.

Chronic idiopathic anal pain,4148541,False,"No, chronic idiopathic anal pain is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic idiopathic anal pain refers to persistent pain in the anal region without a known cause. This condition is not typically associated with pulmonary hypertension, which primarily affects the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular function. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience symptoms such as chest pain, they would not typically present with chronic idiopathic anal pain. Therefore, the presence of chronic idiopathic anal pain does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Familial obesity,4160821,False,"No, familial obesity is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial obesity refers to a genetic predisposition to being overweight or obese, which can increase the risk of various health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. While obesity is a known risk factor for developing pulmonary hypertension, it is not a specific indicator of the condition. Pulmonary hypertension can have various causes, as mentioned in the description, and obesity is just one of many potential contributing factors. Therefore, having familial obesity does not definitively mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."
Pericarditis secondary to collagen vascular disease,4238669,True,"Yes, pericarditis secondary to collagen vascular disease can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart), can be a manifestation of collagen vascular diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. These autoimmune conditions can also be associated with pulmonary hypertension, as mentioned in the description of the malady. Therefore, if a patient has pericarditis secondary to collagen vascular disease, they may also have pulmonary hypertension as a result of the underlying autoimmune condition."
Idiopathic small intestinal ulcers,4263256,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic small intestinal ulcers are not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have gastrointestinal symptoms due to right heart failure, idiopathic small intestinal ulcers are not a defining characteristic of the disease. The presence of idiopathic small intestinal ulcers does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Periarteritis,4296029,False,"No, periarteritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Periarteritis refers to inflammation around arteries, which can be seen in various conditions such as polyarteritis nodosa or giant cell arteritis. While inflammation can contribute to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, periarteritis alone is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary hypertension is specifically characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, as described in the malady description."
Miscarriage with cardiac arrest and/or cardiac failure,4175137,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary Hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may experience symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and signs of right heart failure, a miscarriage with cardiac arrest and/or cardiac failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Miscarriage with cardiac arrest and/or cardiac failure may be caused by a variety of factors unrelated to Pulmonary Hypertension, such as underlying cardiac conditions, blood clotting disorders, or other medical complications. Therefore, the presence of a miscarriage with cardiac arrest and/or cardiac failure does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Atrophy of tunica vaginalis,4175135,False,"No, atrophy of tunica vaginalis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Atrophy of tunica vaginalis refers to the thinning or shrinking of the tunica vaginalis, which is the outer layer of the testis. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having atrophy of tunica vaginalis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Low output heart failure,4103448,True,"Yes, low output heart failure is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Low output heart failure is a common complication of pulmonary hypertension due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. In pulmonary hypertension, the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure can result in right heart failure, which is characterized by low cardiac output. Therefore, if a patient has low output heart failure, it is highly likely that they have pulmonary hypertension as the underlying cause."
Pulmonary endarteritis,4296039,False,"No, pulmonary endarteritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary endarteritis refers to inflammation of the pulmonary artery walls, which can lead to narrowing or blockage of the arteries. While pulmonary endarteritis can be a cause of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), it is not the only cause of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can also be caused by various other conditions as mentioned in the description of the malady, such as idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, or associated with other diseases. Therefore, having pulmonary endarteritis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Cryptogenic sexual precocity,4097301,False,"No

Rationale: Cryptogenic sexual precocity refers to the early onset of puberty in children without a known cause. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as it is unrelated to the pathophysiology or symptoms of PH. While both conditions can occur independently, having cryptogenic sexual precocity does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."

Pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, which can result in pleural effusion due to congestive heart failure. Pleural effusion is a common complication of heart failure, where fluid accumulates in the pleural space due to increased pressure in the heart and blood vessels. Therefore, if a patient has pleural effusion due to congestive heart failure, it is highly likely that they also have pulmonary hypertension as a contributing factor to their condition."
Idiopathic Cushing's syndrome,4099340,False,"No, Idiopathic Cushing's syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Idiopathic Cushing's syndrome is a condition characterized by excessive cortisol production by the adrenal glands, leading to a variety of symptoms such as weight gain, high blood pressure, muscle weakness, and mood changes. While both conditions can have cardiovascular manifestations, they are distinct entities with different underlying pathophysiology. Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, whereas Cushing's syndrome is related to excess cortisol production. Therefore, having Idiopathic Cushing's syndrome does not necessarily mean that a person will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Respiratory failure without hypercapnia,4119934,False,"No.

Rationale: Respiratory failure without hypercapnia is a condition that can have various underlying causes, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right heart failure and ultimately respiratory failure, the presence of respiratory failure without hypercapnia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having respiratory failure without hypercapnia does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Ulcer of tunica vaginalis,4093308,False,"No, an ulcer of the tunica vaginalis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. An ulcer of the tunica vaginalis refers to a lesion or sore on the tunica vaginalis, which is the inner layer of the membrane surrounding the testis. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbidities or conditions, the presence of an ulcer of the tunica vaginalis would not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."

Familial adrenal hypoplasia with absent pituitary luteinizing hormone is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the adrenal glands and pituitary gland, leading to hormonal imbalances. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other underlying conditions, familial adrenal hypoplasia with absent pituitary luteinizing hormone is not a common association with pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic cyst of iris,435542,False,"No, the condition ""Idiopathic cyst of iris"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. An idiopathic cyst of the iris is a benign condition characterized by a fluid-filled sac within the iris of the eye. It is unrelated to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. There is no known association between an idiopathic cyst of the iris and Pulmonary Hypertension."
Familial isolated congenital asplenia,37111653,True,"Yes, familial isolated congenital asplenia is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Familial isolated congenital asplenia is a rare condition characterized by the absence of a spleen from birth, which can lead to an increased risk of infections and other complications. While familial isolated congenital asplenia is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension, it is associated with certain genetic mutations that can predispose individuals to develop other conditions, including pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if an individual has familial isolated congenital asplenia, they may be at an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. However, having pulmonary hypertension does not necessarily mean that an individual has familial isolated congenital asplenia."
Dilated cardiomyopathy associated with connective tissue disorder,4185450,True,"Yes, the condition of Dilated cardiomyopathy associated with connective tissue disorder is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Patients with connective tissue disorders, such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid arthritis, are at an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. In the case of dilated cardiomyopathy associated with a connective tissue disorder, the underlying connective tissue disorder can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication. This connection makes the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy associated with a connective tissue disorder a specific indicator of the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has dilated cardiomyopathy associated with a connective tissue disorder, they definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Cutis laxa secondary to inherited disorder of connective tissue,4298007,True,"Yes, cutis laxa secondary to an inherited disorder of connective tissue can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. In some cases, cutis laxa can be associated with certain genetic conditions that also predispose individuals to developing pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient presents with cutis laxa secondary to an inherited disorder of connective tissue, they may also have an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension."

Interstitial myocarditis is an inflammatory condition affecting the myocardium, or the heart muscle, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or drug reactions. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, interstitial myocarditis is a separate condition that can present with symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and arrhythmias. Therefore, having interstitial myocarditis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Familial hypercholanemia,37109612,False,"No, familial hypercholanemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial hypercholanemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired bile acid synthesis, leading to elevated levels of bile acids in the blood. This condition primarily affects the liver and can result in symptoms such as jaundice, liver dysfunction, and fat malabsorption. While there may be some overlap in symptoms between familial hypercholanemia and pulmonary hypertension, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and pathophysiology. Therefore, having familial hypercholanemia does not definitively mean that an individual will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Familial acute necrotizing encephalopathy,37109611,False,"No, Familial acute necrotizing encephalopathy is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Familial acute necrotizing encephalopathy is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by acute encephalopathy following common viral infections, leading to symmetrical brain lesions and neurological deterioration. This condition primarily affects children and has no direct association with Pulmonary Hypertension."
Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection,35622782,True,"Yes, familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Rationale:
Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection is a genetic condition that can lead to abnormalities in the structure of the aorta, which is the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. In some cases, individuals with this condition may also develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, if a patient has familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection, they may also have pulmonary hypertension as a related condition. However, not all individuals with pulmonary hypertension will have familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection, as there are multiple causes and risk factors for pulmonary hypertension."
Familial pigmented purpuric eruption,4033871,False,"No, familial pigmented purpuric eruption is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial pigmented purpuric eruption is a benign skin condition characterized by red or purple skin lesions, typically on the lower extremities.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is a genetic heart muscle disorder that primarily affects the right ventricle, leading to abnormal heart rhythms and potentially heart failure. While patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their condition, the presence of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia does not definitively mean that a patient will also have pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions are distinct entities with different pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria."
Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction,4101625,True,"Yes, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction can contribute to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension by increasing the workload on the right ventricle and leading to right ventricular dysfunction. This obstruction can result in elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, which is a key characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, they may develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a consequence of this condition."
Haber's syndrome,4320648,False,"No, Haber's syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Haber's syndrome is a fictional condition and not a recognized medical diagnosis. Therefore, it cannot be definitively linked to Pulmonary Hypertension or any other medical condition."

The presence of an idiopathic cyst of the ciliary body does not necessarily indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. These are two separate conditions that affect different parts of the body and have different pathophysiological mechanisms. Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, while an idiopathic cyst of the ciliary body is a benign growth in the eye. Therefore, having an idiopathic cyst of the ciliary body does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Heart failure resolved,44801905,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""heart failure resolved"" does not specifically indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, the resolution of heart failure does not necessarily mean that PH is present. PH can have various etiologies and may present with symptoms of right heart failure, but the resolution of heart failure could be due to other factors or treatments unrelated to PH. Therefore, the presence of ""heart failure resolved"" does not definitively indicate the presence of PH."
Congestive heart failure due to valvular disease,4142561,False,"No. Congestive heart failure due to valvular disease is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, there are many other causes of congestive heart failure, including valvular disease, that are not necessarily related to Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having congestive heart failure due to valvular disease does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."

Therefore, if a patient has idiopathic pulmonary arteriosclerosis, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension."
Familial febrile urticaria,4263346,False,"No, familial febrile urticaria is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial febrile urticaria is a rare autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and urticaria (hives). It is caused by mutations in the NLRP12 gene. This condition does not directly correlate with the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, and having familial febrile urticaria does not necessarily mean that an individual will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic left-sided congestive heart failure,4206009,False,"No, chronic left-sided congestive heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, chronic left-sided congestive heart failure is a separate condition that primarily affects the left side of the heart. While the two conditions can coexist and share some symptoms, they are not always directly related. It is important to evaluate each patient individually to determine the underlying cause of their symptoms and provide appropriate treatment."
Congenital pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm,4101572,True,"Yes, congenital pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Congenital pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm is a rare condition characterized by abnormal connections between pulmonary arteries and veins, leading to shunting of blood and potentially causing pulmonary hypertension. In this case, if a patient has congenital pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm, they would definitely have pulmonary hypertension as a result of this condition. Therefore, the presence of congenital pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm is specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic polyarthritis,4195770,False,"No, idiopathic polyarthritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic polyarthritis refers to joint inflammation of unknown cause, which is typically associated with autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.

It is not a known symptom or sign of Pulmonary Hypertension, which primarily affects the pulmonary vasculature and right heart function. Therefore, the presence of hemorrhage of tunica vaginalis does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Recurrent idiopathic thrombophlebitis,4120115,False,"No, recurrent idiopathic thrombophlebitis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein with blood clot formation) can occur in patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, rather than recurrent thrombophlebitis. Therefore, having recurrent idiopathic thrombophlebitis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
"X-linked intellectual disability, cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure syndrome",36676642,False,"No, the condition ""X-linked intellectual disability, cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure syndrome"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure can be complications of Pulmonary Hypertension due to right ventricular dysfunction, they are not exclusive to this condition. X-linked intellectual disability is a separate condition that is not directly related to Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."

Fetal heart failure,43021735,False,"No, fetal heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, fetal heart failure can have various causes unrelated to PH, such as congenital heart defects, infections, or genetic abnormalities. Therefore, having fetal heart failure does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Familial lambdoid synostosis,35624232,False,"No, familial lambdoid synostosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial lambdoid synostosis is a rare genetic condition characterized by the premature fusion of the lambdoid suture in the skull, leading to an abnormal head shape. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While a patient with familial lambdoid synostosis may potentially have pulmonary hypertension as a comorbidity, the presence of familial lambdoid synostosis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Fetal heart failure with redistribution of cardiac output,43021736,False,"No.

Rationale: Fetal heart failure with redistribution of cardiac output is a condition specific to the fetus and is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension in adults. While both conditions involve heart dysfunction, fetal heart failure with redistribution of cardiac output is typically seen in the context of intrauterine growth restriction or other fetal conditions, whereas pulmonary hypertension is a separate entity characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, having fetal heart failure with redistribution of cardiac output does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic vulvodynia,4048644,False,"No.

Rationale: Idiopathic vulvodynia is a chronic pain condition characterized by pain, burning, or discomfort in the vulvar area without an identifiable cause. It is a localized condition specific to the vulva, and there is no direct relationship between idiopathic vulvodynia and pulmonary hypertension. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may experience various symptoms and complications, including pain, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Therefore, having idiopathic vulvodynia does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Familial absence of villi,4341627,False,"No, familial absence of villi is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial absence of villi is a rare genetic condition characterized by the absence of intestinal villi, leading to malabsorption and other gastrointestinal symptoms. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, and having familial absence of villi does not necessarily mean that an individual will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Familial hematuria,4161286,False,"No, familial hematuria is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial hematuria refers to a condition where blood is present in the urine due to a genetic predisposition, typically caused by abnormalities in the kidneys or urinary tract. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may have familial hematuria as a separate issue, having familial hematuria does not necessarily mean that the patient has or will develop pulmonary hypertension."
Familial osteoarthropathy of the fingers,4208394,False,"No, familial osteoarthropathy of the fingers is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial osteoarthropathy of the fingers is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal thickening and widening of the fingers and toes. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction.

Idiopathic panuveitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye. It is not directly related to the pulmonary vasculature or right ventricular dysfunction, which are key features of pulmonary hypertension. While there may be underlying systemic conditions that can be associated with both idiopathic panuveitis and pulmonary hypertension, having idiopathic panuveitis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to determine if there is a connection between the two conditions in a specific individual."
Familial supernumerary nipple,35624268,False,"No, familial supernumerary nipple is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial supernumerary nipple is a benign condition characterized by the presence of extra nipples, which are typically asymptomatic and do not have any direct association with pulmonary hypertension. These two conditions are unrelated and having familial supernumerary nipple does not mean that an individual definitely has pulmonary hypertension."
Stafne idiopathic bone cavity of mandible,4124522,False,"No, Stafne idiopathic bone cavity of the mandible is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Stafne idiopathic bone cavity of the mandible is a benign radiolucent defect in the mandible that is typically an incidental finding on imaging studies. It is not related to pulmonary hypertension, which is a complex cardiovascular condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature."
Familial atrial fibrillation,37395821,False,"No, familial atrial fibrillation is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia characterized by irregular and often rapid heart rate, which can lead to various complications such as stroke and heart failure. While there may be some overlap in patients with familial atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension, the presence of familial atrial fibrillation does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. These two conditions can coexist in some patients, but they are not directly linked in a way that having one condition guarantees the presence of the other."
Acute left-sided heart failure,4267800,False,"No

Rationale: Acute left-sided heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, acute left-sided heart failure is a separate condition that primarily affects the left side of the heart. It is typically caused by conditions such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, or valvular heart disease. While pulmonary hypertension can be a complication of left-sided heart failure, the presence of acute left-sided heart failure does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic idiopathic immunoneutropenia in adults,4032353,False,"No, chronic idiopathic immunoneutropenia in adults is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic idiopathic immunoneutropenia is a rare condition characterized by a persistent decrease in neutrophil count of unknown cause, leading to an increased risk of infections. While chronic idiopathic immunoneutropenia may be present in patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction."
Idiopathic cervical spinal stenosis,4069210,False,"No, idiopathic cervical spinal stenosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic cervical spinal stenosis refers to a narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck region of unknown cause, leading to compression of the spinal cord and nerves. This condition primarily affects the cervical spine and can result in symptoms such as neck pain, numbness, weakness, and potentially, problems with coordination and walking. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as dyspnea (difficulty breathing) or fatigue, idiopathic cervical spinal stenosis is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria for these two conditions are distinct, with pulmonary hypertension involving elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature and right heart dysfunction, while cervical spinal stenosis involves compression of the spinal cord in the neck."
Familial neonatal seizures,4089691,False,"No, familial neonatal seizures are not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial neonatal seizures refer to a genetic condition characterized by seizures that occur in the neonatal period and have a familial pattern of inheritance. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which is primarily a disorder of the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may potentially have a history of familial neonatal seizures, the presence of familial neonatal seizures does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Acute left-sided congestive heart failure,4327205,False,"No, acute left-sided congestive heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, acute left-sided congestive heart failure specifically refers to a condition where the left side of the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs. This can be caused by various factors such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, or valvular heart disease. While pulmonary hypertension can be a complication of left-sided heart failure, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition."
Congenital dilation of left pulmonary artery,40482073,False,"No, congenital dilation of the left pulmonary artery is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While congenital heart defects can be associated with pulmonary hypertension, not all cases of congenital dilation of the left pulmonary artery will lead to pulmonary hypertension. It is important to evaluate the specific characteristics and hemodynamics of the left pulmonary artery dilation in order to determine if it is contributing to the development of pulmonary hypertension in a given individual. Additional diagnostic testing and evaluation would be necessary to assess the relationship between congenital dilation of the left pulmonary artery and the presence of pulmonary hypertension in a patient."
Salmon patch cornea,4302645,False,"No

Rationale: Salmon patch cornea is a benign condition characterized by a pink or salmon-colored patch on the cornea, typically due to the presence of blood vessels. It is not specific to pulmonary hypertension and does not directly correlate with the pathophysiology or symptoms of the malady."
Erythrocytosis due to alveolar hypoventilation,4249398,True,"Yes, erythrocytosis due to alveolar hypoventilation is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Erythrocytosis, or an increase in red blood cell count, can occur as a compensatory mechanism in response to chronic hypoxia, such as that seen in alveolar hypoventilation. In the context of Pulmonary Hypertension, the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure leads to impaired gas exchange and chronic hypoxia, which can result in erythrocytosis. Therefore, if a patient presents with erythrocytosis due to alveolar hypoventilation, it is highly suggestive of underlying Pulmonary Hypertension as the cause."
Familial hypoaldosteronism,37395783,False,"No, familial hypoaldosteronism is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial hypoaldosteronism is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a decrease in the production of aldosterone, a hormone that helps regulate blood pressure and electrolyte balance. While aldosterone plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure, familial hypoaldosteronism does not directly cause pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having familial hypoaldosteronism does not necessarily mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."
Generalized pruritus of unknown etiology,4296645,False,"No, generalized pruritus of unknown etiology is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Generalized pruritus refers to itching that occurs all over the body without an obvious cause. While pruritus can be a symptom of various conditions, it is not a defining characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. In the context of PH, patients are more likely to present with symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and signs of right heart failure rather than generalized itching. Therefore, the presence of generalized pruritus of unknown etiology does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Normal insertion of arterial duct into proximal left pulmonary artery,43021592,False,"No, the condition of normal insertion of the arterial duct into the proximal left pulmonary artery is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. This condition refers to a normal anatomical variation in the positioning of the arterial duct, which is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which is not directly influenced by the insertion of the arterial duct. Therefore, having a normal insertion of the arterial duct into the proximal left pulmonary artery does not necessarily indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypertension secondary to drug,4108213,False,"No, the condition ""Hypertension secondary to drug"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While drug-induced hypertension can be a potential cause of secondary pulmonary hypertension, there are many other possible causes of drug-induced hypertension that do not necessarily lead to Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having drug-induced hypertension does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Familial isolated clinodactyly of finger,35622287,False,"No, familial isolated clinodactyly of the finger is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial isolated clinodactyly of the finger is a congenital condition characterized by a deviation of the finger towards the thumb or little finger. It is a benign condition that does not have a direct association with pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic glomerulonephritis,45772072,False,"No, idiopathic glomerulonephritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic glomerulonephritis refers to inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidneys of unknown cause, while pulmonary hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. These two conditions affect different organ systems and have distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may have idiopathic glomerulonephritis as a comorbidity, the presence of idiopathic glomerulonephritis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Colloid milium,4298709,False,"No, colloid milium is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Colloid milium is a rare cutaneous condition characterized by the deposition of colloid material in the skin, typically presenting as yellowish papules or nodules. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other skin manifestations due to underlying conditions or medications, colloid milium is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension."
Familial disease with storage of sterols (other than cholesterol),4239320,False,"No, the condition of familial disease with storage of sterols (other than cholesterol) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While there are various etiologies that can lead to Pulmonary Hypertension, familial diseases with storage of sterols (other than cholesterol) are not commonly associated with this condition. Pulmonary Hypertension is more commonly associated with conditions such as idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having the condition of familial disease with storage of sterols (other than cholesterol) does not definitively mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Retinal arterial macroaneurysm with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis,35607996,False,"No, the condition ""Retinal arterial macroaneurysm with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While both conditions involve the cardiovascular system, they are distinct entities with different pathophysiological mechanisms and diagnostic criteria. Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction, while supravalvular pulmonic stenosis is a congenital heart defect involving narrowing of the pulmonary artery above the valve. Retinal arterial macroaneurysm is a vascular abnormality in the eye that is not directly related to either of these conditions. Therefore, having the condition does not definitively mean that one has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Atrioventricular septal defect with atrioventricular valve regurgitation,40488397,True,"Yes, the condition ""Atrioventricular septal defect with atrioventricular valve regurgitation"" is specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) is a congenital heart defect that can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension over time. Additionally, atrioventricular valve regurgitation can contribute to right ventricular dysfunction, which is a common complication of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has AVSD with atrioventricular valve regurgitation, they are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension as a result of these cardiac abnormalities."
Indian childhood cirrhosis,4268006,False,"No, Indian childhood cirrhosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Indian childhood cirrhosis is a rare form of liver disease that primarily affects children in India, characterized by liver damage and scarring. While liver disease can sometimes be associated with pulmonary hypertension, Indian childhood cirrhosis does not directly cause pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions are distinct entities with different pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical presentations."
Requires mechanical ventilatory assistance,3190682,False,"No, the condition ""Requires mechanical ventilatory assistance"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with severe Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right heart failure and require ventilatory support, the need for mechanical ventilation can be due to a variety of other conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, or neuromuscular disorders. Therefore, the presence of mechanical ventilatory assistance does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic recurrent stupor,35622321,False,"No, idiopathic recurrent stupor is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Idiopathic recurrent stupor refers to a condition characterized by episodes of sudden, temporary unconsciousness or altered mental status of unknown cause. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may experience symptoms such as fatigue and syncope, idiopathic recurrent stupor is not a defining symptom or characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic recurrent stupor does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Normal insertion of arterial ligament into proximal left pulmonary artery,43021601,False,"No, the condition of normal insertion of the arterial ligament into the proximal left pulmonary artery is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. This condition refers to a normal anatomical variation and does not directly correlate with the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which is not related to the insertion of the arterial ligament. Therefore, having this condition does not necessarily mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acquired abnormality of pulmonary venous structure,43021605,False,"No, the condition ""Acquired abnormality of pulmonary venous structure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While abnormalities in the pulmonary venous structure can contribute to pulmonary hypertension, there are many other potential causes of PH as outlined in the description of the malady. Therefore, having an acquired abnormality of pulmonary venous structure does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to confirm the presence of PH in this case."
Familial vesicoureteral reflux,35622309,False,"No, familial vesicoureteral reflux is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial vesicoureteral reflux is a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder into the ureters or kidneys, which can lead to urinary tract infections and kidney damage. It is a separate condition from pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may have other conditions such as familial vesicoureteral reflux, the presence of familial vesicoureteral reflux does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Familial hyperprolactinemia,35622308,False,"No, familial hyperprolactinemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of the hormone prolactin in the blood, which can be caused by various factors such as medications, pituitary tumors, or other underlying conditions. While it is possible for a person with familial hyperprolactinemia to also have pulmonary hypertension, the two conditions are not directly related or specific to each other."
Familial multiple nevi flammei,35622307,False,"No, familial multiple nevi flammei is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial multiple nevi flammei refers to the presence of multiple red or pink papules on the skin, which are benign vascular lesions. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Therefore, having familial multiple nevi flammei does not necessarily mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Right ventricular thrombus,4206589,False,"No

Rationale: While right ventricular thrombus can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Right ventricular thrombus can also occur in other conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, and other hypercoagulable states. Therefore, the presence of a right ventricular thrombus does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia,35622306,False,"No, idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is a rare immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a low CD4 T-cell count in the absence of HIV infection or any other known cause. While patients with idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia may present with various symptoms related to immune dysfunction, there is no direct association between this condition and pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions have different pathophysiological mechanisms and etiologies."
Familial hypergastrinemic duodenal ulcer,4194177,False,"No.

Rationale:
Familial hypergastrinemic duodenal ulcer is a condition characterized by elevated levels of gastrin in the blood, leading to the development of duodenal ulcers. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as it primarily affects the gastrointestinal system and does not directly involve the pulmonary vasculature or right ventricular dysfunction. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may potentially have other comorbid conditions such as duodenal ulcers, the presence of familial hypergastrinemic duodenal ulcer does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Acquired central alveolar hypoventilation,46269699,False,"No, acquired central alveolar hypoventilation is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Acquired central alveolar hypoventilation refers to a condition where there is a decrease in the drive to breathe, leading to inadequate ventilation of the alveoli. This can result in hypercapnia and hypoxemia. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may experience symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, acquired central alveolar hypoventilation is not a defining characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. These two conditions can coexist in some cases, but having acquired central alveolar hypoventilation does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Cardiomegaly - hypertensive,4173820,False,"No

Rationale: Cardiomegaly, or an enlarged heart, can be caused by a variety of conditions, including hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of cardiomegaly due to hypertension will specifically lead to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having cardiomegaly due to hypertension does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Neurofibroma,4300676,False,"No, neurofibroma is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Neurofibroma is a benign nerve sheath tumor that arises from the cells that cover nerves. It is typically associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or can occur sporadically. While neurofibromas can present with various symptoms depending on their location, they are not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions involve different pathophysiological processes and do not have a direct causal relationship."
Familial isolated trichomegaly,35608024,False,"No, familial isolated trichomegaly is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Trichomegaly refers to the abnormal lengthening or thickening of eyelashes, which can be a genetic condition or associated with certain medications or medical conditions. While trichomegaly can be seen in some patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining or specific symptom of the disease. Therefore, having familial isolated trichomegaly does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Dilatation of annulus of aortic valve,40492453,False,"No, dilatation of the annulus of the aortic valve is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, dilatation of the annulus of the aortic valve is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. This condition may be seen in other cardiac conditions such as aortic valve regurgitation or aortic root dilation. Therefore, having dilatation of the annulus of the aortic valve does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Familial hypertryptophanemia,36716028,False,"No, familial hypertryptophanemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial hypertryptophanemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by elevated levels of tryptophan in the blood, leading to symptoms such as intellectual disability, seizures, and behavioral issues. There is no direct link between familial hypertryptophanemia and pulmonary hypertension based on current medical knowledge."

Idiopathic hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive absorption of dietary iron, leading to iron overload in various organs such as the liver, heart, pancreas, and joints. While iron overload can potentially lead to heart failure and other complications, it is not directly linked to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic hemochromatosis does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter,37395937,False,"No, idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter refers to a specific type of abnormal heart rhythm that occurs in newborns, which is not directly related to the elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. While both conditions can affect the heart, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes and pathophysiology. It is possible for a patient to have idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter without having pulmonary hypertension, and vice versa."
Familial cortical myoclonus,35622338,False,"No

Rationale: Familial cortical myoclonus is a rare genetic disorder characterized by sudden, involuntary muscle jerks or twitches (myoclonus) that primarily affect the arms and legs. This condition is not specifically associated with pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience muscle weakness or fatigue as symptoms of right heart failure, familial cortical myoclonus is not a known symptom or complication of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having familial cortical myoclonus does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic hirsutism,4065246,False,"No, idiopathic hirsutism is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hirsutism refers to the presence of excessive hair growth in women in a male-pattern distribution without an identifiable underlying cause. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with various conditions, there is no direct link between idiopathic hirsutism and pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions involve different physiological processes and do not have a known causal relationship."
Compensated cardiac failure,4108244,False,"No

Rationale: Compensated cardiac failure refers to a state in which the heart is able to maintain adequate cardiac output despite underlying heart dysfunction. In the case of pulmonary hypertension, the elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has compensated cardiac failure, it may be a sign of underlying pulmonary hypertension, but not all cases of compensated cardiac failure are specifically indicative of pulmonary hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation, such as right heart catheterization, would be needed to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension in this scenario."
Acute left ventricular failure,4108245,False,"No

Rationale: Acute left ventricular failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, acute left ventricular failure specifically refers to a sudden onset of heart failure due to dysfunction of the left ventricle. This can be caused by various factors such as myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having acute left ventricular failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Mixed collagen vascular disease,4134867,True,"Yes, mixed collagen vascular disease is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Mixed collagen vascular disease, also known as mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), is a condition that combines features of multiple autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis. Patients with MCTD can develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their autoimmune disease. Pulmonary hypertension is a known manifestation of connective tissue diseases, including MCTD. Therefore, if a patient has mixed collagen vascular disease, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of their underlying autoimmune condition."
Idiopathic granulomatous interstitial nephropathy,4018127,False,"No, idiopathic granulomatous interstitial nephropathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic granulomatous interstitial nephropathy is a rare form of interstitial nephritis characterized by the presence of granulomas in the kidney tissue. It is primarily a kidney disorder and does not directly correlate with pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbidities, there is no direct link between idiopathic granulomatous interstitial nephropathy and pulmonary hypertension based on current medical knowledge."
Necrotizing vasculitis secondary to connective tissue disease,4292533,True,"Yes, the condition of necrotizing vasculitis secondary to connective tissue disease is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Necrotizing vasculitis is a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to blood vessel walls, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication of connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus. The presence of necrotizing vasculitis in the context of a connective tissue disease can contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension through vascular remodeling and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Therefore, if a patient has necrotizing vasculitis secondary to a connective tissue disease, they are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension as a result of this condition."
Heart failure with mid range ejection fraction,37311948,False,"No, heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction can have various causes, including ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Familial duodenal ulcer associated with rapid gastric emptying,4040644,False,"No

Rationale: The condition of familial duodenal ulcer associated with rapid gastric emptying is not specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. These two conditions are unrelated and do not have a direct causal relationship.
