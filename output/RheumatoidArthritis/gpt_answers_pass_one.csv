Disorder of thorax,4043346,False,"No.

A ""disorder of thorax"" is a broad term that can encompass a wide range of conditions affecting the chest area, including but not limited to respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal disorders. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can potentially involve the thoracic region, particularly in the form of costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the sternum) or interstitial lung disease, these manifestations are not specific to RA. Many other conditions can also cause disorders of the thorax, such as infections, trauma, malignancies, and other autoimmune diseases.

Therefore, having a ""disorder of thorax"" does not definitively indicate that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Soft tissue lesion,4344497,False,"No.

A soft tissue lesion is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Soft tissue lesions can occur due to a variety of reasons, including trauma, infections, benign or malignant tumors, and other inflammatory conditions. While RA can involve soft tissue structures around the joints, such as tendons and bursae, leading to conditions like tenosynovitis or bursitis, the presence of a soft tissue lesion alone does not definitively indicate RA. Therefore, having a soft tissue lesion does not mean that a person definitely has RA."
Disorder of free lower limb,44782620,False,"No.

A ""disorder of free lower limb"" is a broad and non-specific condition that can encompass a wide range of issues affecting the lower limbs, such as injuries, infections, vascular problems, neurological disorders, and various types of arthritis, including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While RA can certainly affect the lower limbs, particularly the joints in the feet and knees, having a disorder of the lower limb does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. There are many other potential causes for lower limb disorders that are not related to RA. Therefore, the condition ""disorder of free lower limb"" is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Complication,433128,False,"No.

The term ""complication"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). A complication refers to an additional medical problem that arises during the course of a disease or condition, which can occur with many different diseases, not just RA. For example, complications can arise in conditions like diabetes, heart disease, infections, and many other medical issues. Therefore, having a complication does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder,4208786,False,"No.

Rationale: ""Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder"" is a broad category that encompasses a wide range of conditions affecting the muscles, bones, and connective tissues. While Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is indeed a type of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder, not all musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders are RA. This category includes other conditions such as osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), fibromyalgia, and many others. Therefore, having a musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder does not specifically indicate that a person has RA."
Osteoarthritis,80180,False,"No.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While both conditions involve joint pain and can affect similar joints, they are distinct diseases with different pathophysiologies. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage and is primarily a mechanical wear-and-tear condition, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that causes systemic inflammation and primarily affects the synovial lining of the joints.

Having osteoarthritis does not mean that a person definitely has rheumatoid arthritis. In fact, OA is more common and can occur independently of RA. Therefore, the presence of osteoarthritis is not specific to RA."
Disorder of lung,257907,False,"No.

A disorder of the lung is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can be associated with lung involvement, such as interstitial lung disease or pleuritis, having a lung disorder does not definitively mean that a person has RA. Lung disorders can arise from a multitude of other causes, including infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, lung cancer, and other autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the presence of a lung disorder alone is not specific to RA."
Joint injury,4054054,False,"No.

Rationale: Joint injury is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Joint injuries can occur due to a variety of reasons such as trauma, overuse, or mechanical stress, and are not necessarily indicative of an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA. While individuals with RA may experience joint damage and injury as a consequence of the disease, the presence of a joint injury alone does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. Joint injuries can also be seen in other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, or even in the absence of any underlying chronic disease. Therefore, having a joint injury does not mean that one definitely has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammatory disorder of extremity,4181064,False,"No.

An ""inflammatory disorder of extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA is indeed an inflammatory disorder that often affects the extremities, there are many other conditions that can also cause inflammation in the extremities. These include, but are not limited to, osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and various types of infections or injuries.

Therefore, having an inflammatory disorder of the extremity does not definitively mean that a person has RA. It could be indicative of a range of other conditions as well."
Inflammation of skin and/or subcutaneous tissue,4181062,False,"No.

Inflammation of the skin and/or subcutaneous tissue is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA is primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints, it can have systemic manifestations, including skin involvement such as rheumatoid nodules or vasculitis. However, inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue can occur in a wide variety of other conditions, including infections, other autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis), allergic reactions, and other forms of arthritis.

Therefore, the presence of inflammation of the skin and/or subcutaneous tissue does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. It is a non-specific condition that can be associated with many different maladies."
Degenerative disorder of cartilage,4180010,False,"No.

A degenerative disorder of cartilage is more characteristic of osteoarthritis rather than rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is primarily a degenerative joint disease where the cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones in the joints deteriorates over time. This leads to pain, swelling, and reduced motion in the joints.

Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints and leads to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction due to the immune system attacking the joint linings. While RA can lead to joint damage and secondary cartilage degeneration over time, the primary pathology is inflammation rather than degeneration of cartilage.

Therefore, having a degenerative disorder of cartilage does not specifically indicate that a person has rheumatoid arthritis; it is more indicative of osteoarthritis."
Pneumonitis,253506,False,"No.

Pneumonitis is an inflammation of the lung tissue, which can be caused by various factors including infections, radiation therapy, medications, and autoimmune diseases. While pneumonitis can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) as a complication or extra-articular manifestation, it is not specific to RA. Pneumonitis can also be seen in a variety of other conditions, including other autoimmune diseases, infections, and exposure to certain environmental factors.

Therefore, having pneumonitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. It could be associated with RA, but it is not exclusive to it."
Disorder of hand,77635,False,"No.

A ""disorder of hand"" is a broad term that can encompass a wide range of conditions affecting the hand, including but not limited to carpal tunnel syndrome, osteoarthritis, tendinitis, and trauma-related injuries. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can certainly cause disorders of the hand, particularly in the form of joint pain, swelling, and deformities, having a disorder of the hand does not definitively mean that a person has RA. There are many other potential causes for hand disorders that are not related to RA. Therefore, a disorder of the hand is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic disease of immune function,4188970,False,"No.

Rationale: While Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is indeed a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder, the condition ""chronic disease of immune function"" is not specific to RA. There are numerous chronic diseases of immune function, including but not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, having a chronic disease of immune function does not definitively mean that a person has RA. It indicates that the person has some form of chronic immune dysfunction, but it could be one of many different autoimmune or immune-related conditions."
Disorder of body wall,4266188,False,"No, a ""disorder of body wall"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

Rationale:
A ""disorder of body wall"" is a broad term that can encompass a variety of conditions affecting the structures that make up the body wall, including muscles, fascia, and skin. This term is not specific to any one disease and can be associated with numerous conditions, such as hernias, muscle strains, or infections. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a specific autoimmune condition primarily affecting the synovial joints, leading to inflammation, pain, and potential joint destruction. While RA can cause systemic symptoms and may affect other parts of the body, the term ""disorder of body wall"" does not specifically indicate RA. Therefore, having a disorder of the body wall does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Autoimmune disease,434621,False,"No.

Rationale: While Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is indeed an autoimmune disease, not all autoimmune diseases are RA. There are numerous autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes, and many others. Therefore, having an autoimmune disease does not specifically mean that one has RA. The condition of having an autoimmune disease is not specific to RA, as it encompasses a broad category of disorders beyond just RA."
Disorder of joint of ankle and/or foot,40482662,False,"No.

Rationale: While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can affect the joints of the ankle and foot, a disorder of the joint in these areas is not specific to RA. There are many other conditions that can cause joint disorders in the ankle and foot, such as osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, and traumatic injuries. Therefore, having a disorder of the joint in the ankle and/or foot does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Disorder of soft tissue of upper limb,4090616,False,"No.

A ""disorder of soft tissue of the upper limb"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can certainly affect the soft tissues of the upper limb, leading to conditions such as tendonitis, bursitis, or tenosynovitis, these soft tissue disorders can also be caused by a wide range of other conditions. These include but are not limited to overuse injuries, trauma, infections, other types of arthritis (e.g., osteoarthritis), and systemic conditions like diabetes or thyroid disease.

Therefore, having a disorder of the soft tissue of the upper limb does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. It is a non-specific condition that can be associated with many different maladies."
Disorder of nail,132706,False,"No.

A disorder of the nail, such as nail pitting, onycholysis, or other nail abnormalities, is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While nail disorders can be associated with RA, they are also common in a variety of other conditions, including psoriasis, fungal infections, and other systemic diseases. Therefore, having a nail disorder does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Disorder of joint of shoulder region,40484571,False,"No, a disorder of the joint of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

Rationale:
- Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple joints throughout the body, including the shoulder joints. However, a disorder of the joint of the shoulder region can be caused by a variety of other conditions as well.
- Other potential causes of shoulder joint disorders include osteoarthritis, rotator cuff injuries, bursitis, tendinitis, frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis), and traumatic injuries, among others.
- Therefore, while RA can involve the shoulder joints, the presence of a shoulder joint disorder alone does not definitively indicate RA. It could be due to any number of other conditions affecting the shoulder.

Thus, the condition ""disorder of joint of shoulder region"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of finger,4027258,False,"No.

A ""disorder of finger"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can certainly cause disorders of the fingers, such as swelling, pain, and deformities, these symptoms can also be caused by a variety of other conditions. For example, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and even traumatic injuries can all lead to finger disorders. Therefore, having a disorder of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Articular cartilage disorder,439103,False,"No.

Articular cartilage disorder refers to any condition that affects the cartilage within joints. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can lead to damage of the articular cartilage due to chronic inflammation and joint destruction, articular cartilage disorders can also be caused by a variety of other conditions, such as osteoarthritis, traumatic injuries, or other inflammatory diseases.

Therefore, having an articular cartilage disorder does not specifically indicate that a person has rheumatoid arthritis. It could be due to other causes as well. Hence, the condition of having an articular cartilage disorder is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Disorder of ankle joint,443583,False,"No.

A ""disorder of the ankle joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can certainly affect the ankle joints, leading to pain, swelling, and functional impairment, disorders of the ankle joint can also be caused by a variety of other conditions. These include osteoarthritis, gout, traumatic injuries, infections, and other inflammatory conditions such as psoriatic arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, having a disorder of the ankle joint does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Injury of finger,81454,False,"No.

An injury of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Finger injuries can occur due to a wide variety of reasons, such as trauma, accidents, sports injuries, or repetitive strain. While RA can cause joint pain, swelling, and deformities in the fingers, the presence of a finger injury alone does not definitively indicate RA. Finger injuries are common and can be seen in individuals without any underlying autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Therefore, having a finger injury does not mean that a person definitely has RA."
Disorder of glenohumeral joint,4328821,False,"No.

A disorder of the glenohumeral joint (the shoulder joint) is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can affect the shoulder joints and cause inflammation, pain, and dysfunction in the glenohumeral joint, this condition can also be caused by a variety of other issues such as osteoarthritis, rotator cuff injuries, frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis), or traumatic injuries. Therefore, having a disorder of the glenohumeral joint does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Disorder in remission,35622958,False,"No.

Rationale: The condition ""disorder in remission"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Remission can occur in a variety of chronic diseases, including other autoimmune disorders, cancers, and chronic infections. While RA can indeed go into remission, the state of being in remission does not definitively indicate that the underlying disorder is RA. Therefore, having a disorder in remission does not mean that one definitely has RA."
Lower limb joint arthritis,4094283,False,"No.

Lower limb joint arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can certainly affect the joints of the lower limbs, arthritis in these joints can also be caused by a variety of other conditions, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and other inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases. Therefore, the presence of lower limb joint arthritis does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Inflammation of sacroiliac joint,4208390,False,"No.

Inflammation of the sacroiliac joint, also known as sacroiliitis, is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly the small joints of the hands and feet, sacroiliitis is more commonly associated with other conditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis and other forms of spondyloarthropathies. 

RA can involve various joints and may occasionally affect the sacroiliac joints, but this is not a defining or specific feature of RA. Therefore, the presence of sacroiliitis does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Interstitial lung disease,4119786,False,"No.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While ILD can occur in patients with RA as a complication, it is not exclusive to RA. ILD can be associated with a variety of other conditions, including other autoimmune diseases (such as systemic sclerosis and polymyositis), environmental exposures, infections, and idiopathic causes. Therefore, having ILD does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Arthritis of elbow,4205509,False,"No.

Arthritis of the elbow is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in the elbow, arthritis in this joint can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, or trauma. Therefore, having arthritis of the elbow does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Inflammatory polyarthropathy,74125,False,"No.

Inflammatory polyarthropathy refers to inflammation affecting multiple joints and can be a feature of various conditions, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA is a common cause of inflammatory polyarthropathy, other conditions such as psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases can also present with inflammatory polyarthropathy. Therefore, having inflammatory polyarthropathy does not definitively mean that a person has RA; it could be indicative of several different underlying conditions."
Arthritis of spine,4153359,False,"No.

Arthritis of the spine, also known as spinal arthritis, can be caused by various conditions, including osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other forms of inflammatory arthritis. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can affect the spine, particularly the cervical spine, it is not specific to RA. Other conditions can also cause arthritis of the spine, so having arthritis of the spine does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. Therefore, arthritis of the spine is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of shoulder region joint,40483262,False,"No.

Arthritis of the shoulder region joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can indeed affect the shoulder joints, it is not the only condition that can cause arthritis in this region. Other forms of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, can also affect the shoulder joints. Additionally, conditions like rotator cuff injuries, bursitis, and other inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases can present with arthritis in the shoulder region. Therefore, having arthritis in the shoulder region does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Rheumatoid factor level - finding,4267510,False,"No.

Rationale: While the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) can be associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Rheumatoid factor can be found in other conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and even in some healthy individuals, particularly the elderly. Therefore, having an elevated rheumatoid factor level does not definitively mean that a person has RA. It is one of several criteria used in the diagnosis of RA, but it is not exclusive to it."
Post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis,253797,False,"No.

Post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis is a condition characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the lungs following inflammation. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can lead to various extra-articular manifestations, including lung involvement such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary fibrosis, post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis is not specific to RA. It can occur due to a variety of other causes, including infections, other autoimmune diseases, environmental exposures, and certain medications.

Therefore, having post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis does not definitively indicate that a person has rheumatoid arthritis. It could be associated with RA, but it is not specific to it."
Rheumatoid factor positive,4013263,False,"No.

Rationale:
While the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) can be a significant indicator in the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that can be found in the blood of many people with RA, but it can also be present in individuals with other autoimmune diseases, infections, and even in some healthy individuals, particularly the elderly. Conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, and chronic infections like hepatitis C can also present with a positive rheumatoid factor. Therefore, having a positive rheumatoid factor does not definitively mean that a person has RA, making it non-specific to RA."
Rheumatic heart disease,319825,False,"No.

Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Rheumatic heart disease is a condition resulting from rheumatic fever, which is caused by an autoimmune response to a Group A Streptococcus infection. It primarily affects the heart valves, leading to their damage and dysfunction.

While both RA and RHD are autoimmune conditions, they have different etiologies and affect different parts of the body. RA primarily targets the synovial joints, causing inflammation, pain, and potential joint destruction. In contrast, RHD affects the heart valves and is a sequela of rheumatic fever, not RA.

Therefore, having rheumatic heart disease does not definitively indicate that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of knee,4159739,False,"No.

Arthritis of the knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in the knee, arthritis of the knee can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, and septic arthritis, among others. Therefore, having arthritis of the knee does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Disorder of right upper extremity,764153,False,"No.

A ""disorder of the right upper extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can certainly affect the right upper extremity, it is a systemic condition that typically involves multiple joints symmetrically, including both upper extremities, lower extremities, and other joints. Disorders of the right upper extremity can be caused by a wide range of conditions, including but not limited to osteoarthritis, tendinitis, bursitis, fractures, nerve entrapment syndromes (like carpal tunnel syndrome), and other localized or systemic conditions.

Therefore, having a disorder of the right upper extremity does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. It could be due to many other causes, and thus it is not specific to RA."
Chronic arthropathy,4189855,False,"No.

Chronic arthropathy refers to a long-term joint disease, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While RA is a type of chronic arthropathy, there are many other causes of chronic arthropathy, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and ankylosing spondylitis, among others. Therefore, having chronic arthropathy does not specifically mean that a person has RA. It indicates a long-term joint condition, but it is not exclusive to RA."
Disorder of left upper extremity,764154,False,"No.

A ""disorder of the left upper extremity"" is a broad and non-specific condition that can result from a variety of causes, including trauma, infections, other types of arthritis (such as osteoarthritis), nerve compression syndromes (like carpal tunnel syndrome), and many other musculoskeletal or systemic conditions. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can certainly affect the left upper extremity, having a disorder in this area does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. Therefore, the condition ""disorder of the left upper extremity"" is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Shoulder joint inflamed,4184089,False,"No.

While shoulder joint inflammation can occur in individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Shoulder joint inflammation can be caused by a variety of other conditions, including but not limited to osteoarthritis, rotator cuff injuries, bursitis, tendinitis, and other forms of inflammatory arthritis such as psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, the presence of shoulder joint inflammation alone does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Soft tissue lesion of elbow region,4344259,False,"No.

A soft tissue lesion of the elbow region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause inflammation and damage to the soft tissues around joints, including the elbow, soft tissue lesions in the elbow region can also be caused by a variety of other conditions. These include trauma, overuse injuries (such as tendinitis or bursitis), infections, and other types of arthritis (such as osteoarthritis or gout). Therefore, the presence of a soft tissue lesion in the elbow region does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Splenomegaly,200527,False,"No.

Splenomegaly, which is the enlargement of the spleen, is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While splenomegaly can occur in a variety of conditions, including some autoimmune diseases, it is not a hallmark or defining feature of RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The presence of splenomegaly could suggest other conditions such as infections, hematologic diseases, liver diseases, or other autoimmune disorders, but it does not definitively indicate RA. Therefore, having splenomegaly does not mean that a person definitely has RA."
Disorder of subcutaneous tissue,4132999,False,"No.

A disorder of subcutaneous tissue is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Subcutaneous tissue disorders can encompass a wide range of conditions, including infections, lipomas, cysts, and other inflammatory or neoplastic processes. While RA can involve inflammation that affects various tissues, including subcutaneous tissue, having a disorder of subcutaneous tissue does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. Therefore, the presence of a subcutaneous tissue disorder is not specific to RA."
Ankylosing spondylitis,437082,False,"No.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a distinct condition from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While both are types of inflammatory arthritis, they have different pathophysiologies, clinical presentations, and diagnostic criteria. Ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to inflammation and eventual fusion of the vertebrae, whereas rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly the small joints of the hands and feet, and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis.

Having ankylosing spondylitis does not mean that a person definitely has rheumatoid arthritis. They are separate diseases with different clinical features, genetic markers, and treatment approaches. Therefore, the condition of ankylosing spondylitis is not specific to the malady of rheumatoid arthritis."
Alveolar pneumopathy,4252581,False,"No.

Alveolar pneumopathy refers to a condition affecting the alveoli in the lungs, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, environmental exposures, or autoimmune diseases. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can have extra-articular manifestations, including lung involvement (e.g., interstitial lung disease, rheumatoid nodules in the lungs), alveolar pneumopathy is not specific to RA. It can occur in a variety of other conditions, including infections, other autoimmune diseases, and environmental exposures.

Therefore, having alveolar pneumopathy does not definitively indicate that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Seronegative arthritis,4163270,False,"No.

Rationale: Seronegative arthritis refers to a group of arthritic conditions where the patient does not have the specific serological markers typically associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. While seronegative arthritis can include RA, it also encompasses other types of arthritis such as psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and reactive arthritis. Therefore, having seronegative arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has RA, as it could indicate one of several other arthritic conditions."
Autoimmune connective tissue disorder,4179877,False,"No.

Rationale:
An autoimmune connective tissue disorder is a broad category that includes a variety of diseases where the immune system attacks the body's own connective tissues. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is indeed one type of autoimmune connective tissue disorder, but it is not the only one. Other examples include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, and Sjögren's syndrome, among others.

Therefore, having an autoimmune connective tissue disorder does not specifically mean that a person has RA. They could have any one of the other disorders within this category. Thus, the condition ""autoimmune connective tissue disorder"" is not specific to RA."
Systemic vasculitis,4264033,False,"No.

Systemic vasculitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While systemic vasculitis can occur in patients with RA, it is not exclusive to RA and can be seen in a variety of other conditions, including other autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa), infections, and even as a primary condition without an underlying disease. Therefore, the presence of systemic vasculitis does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Chronic arthritis,4262443,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic arthritis is a broad term that refers to long-term inflammation of the joints, which can be caused by various conditions, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA is a type of chronic arthritis, other conditions such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis can also cause chronic arthritis. Therefore, having chronic arthritis does not specifically mean that a person has RA."
Arthritis of joint of left shoulder region,759883,False,"No.

Arthritis of the joint of the left shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can affect the shoulder joints, it is not the only condition that can cause arthritis in the shoulder. Other forms of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, can also affect the shoulder joint. Additionally, shoulder arthritis can result from other conditions like rotator cuff tear arthropathy, post-traumatic arthritis, or septic arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis in the left shoulder does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Arthritis of joint of right shoulder region,759884,False,"No.

Arthritis of the joint of the right shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can affect the shoulder joints, it is not exclusive to RA and can be seen in other types of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and even in conditions like rotator cuff injuries or bursitis. Therefore, having arthritis in the right shoulder does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,4253901,False,"No.

Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), is a different condition from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite some similarities. JRA/JIA is a type of arthritis that occurs in children under the age of 16 and can present with symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. While both conditions involve joint inflammation and can lead to joint damage, they are distinct entities with different diagnostic criteria and age of onset.

Having juvenile rheumatoid arthritis does not mean that one definitely has rheumatoid arthritis, as they are separate diagnoses. Therefore, the condition of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is not specific to the malady of rheumatoid arthritis."
Small vessel vasculitis,37110370,False,"No.

Small vessel vasculitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While small vessel vasculitis can occur in patients with RA, it is not exclusive to RA and can be seen in a variety of other conditions. Small vessel vasculitis involves inflammation of the small blood vessels and can be associated with other autoimmune diseases, infections, and even certain medications. Therefore, the presence of small vessel vasculitis does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Atrophic condition of skin,134118,False,"No.

An atrophic condition of the skin, which refers to thinning or wasting away of the skin, is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While skin changes can occur in RA, they are not a defining or specific feature of the disease. Atrophic skin conditions can be caused by a variety of factors, including aging, prolonged use of topical steroids, certain genetic conditions, and other systemic diseases. Therefore, having an atrophic condition of the skin does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Pericarditis,4138837,False,"No.

Pericarditis, which is inflammation of the pericardium (the fibrous sac surrounding the heart), is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While pericarditis can occur in patients with RA due to the systemic inflammatory nature of the disease, it is not exclusive to RA. Pericarditis can also be caused by a variety of other conditions, including infections (viral, bacterial, fungal), other autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), myocardial infarction, trauma, and certain medications, among others.

Therefore, having pericarditis does not definitively indicate that a person has RA, as it can be associated with many other conditions."
Injury of nail,4167909,False,"No.

An injury of the nail is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Nail injuries can occur due to a variety of reasons such as trauma, fungal infections, or other dermatological conditions. While RA can affect the small joints of the hands and potentially lead to changes in the nails due to joint deformities or secondary conditions, a nail injury itself is not a definitive indicator of RA. Therefore, having a nail injury does not mean that a person definitely has RA."
Arthritis of hand,40490497,False,"No.

Arthritis of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA commonly affects the small joints of the hands, leading to arthritis in these areas, arthritis of the hand can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, having arthritis of the hand does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. It is a symptom that can be seen in multiple different types of arthritis and other conditions."
Pneumoconiosis,259044,False,"No.

Pneumoconiosis is a group of lung diseases caused by the inhalation of certain dusts and the lung tissue's reaction to the dust. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the joints, pneumoconiosis is a respiratory condition resulting from occupational exposure to dust. The presence of pneumoconiosis does not indicate that a person definitely has RA. Therefore, pneumoconiosis is not specific to RA."
Injury of blood vessel,192763,False,"No.

An injury of a blood vessel is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, an injury of a blood vessel can occur due to a wide variety of reasons, including trauma, surgical procedures, or other medical conditions such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, or clotting disorders. 

In RA, vascular involvement can occur, but it is not a defining or specific feature of the disease. Therefore, having an injury of a blood vessel does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Autoimmune skin disease,4319304,False,"No.

Rationale:
An autoimmune skin disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA is an autoimmune disorder, it primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Autoimmune skin diseases, such as psoriasis or lupus erythematosus, involve the skin and are distinct conditions with their own specific pathophysiology and clinical presentations.

Having an autoimmune skin disease does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. Autoimmune skin diseases can occur independently of RA and are associated with other autoimmune conditions. Therefore, the presence of an autoimmune skin disease is not specific to RA."
Chronic polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,72714,False,"No.

Chronic polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is a specific subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), which is a different condition from adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While both conditions share similarities, such as being autoimmune diseases that cause joint inflammation, they are distinct entities with different diagnostic criteria, age of onset, and potentially different treatment approaches.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including its polyarticular form, is diagnosed in children under the age of 16 and has its own set of diagnostic criteria. Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, typically affects adults and has different clinical and serological markers.

Therefore, having chronic polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis does not definitively mean that one has rheumatoid arthritis, as they are separate conditions."
Chemical-induced dermatological disorder,4033051,False,"No.

A chemical-induced dermatological disorder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Chemical-induced dermatological disorders can result from exposure to various chemicals and can manifest as skin irritation, rashes, or other skin conditions. These disorders are not directly related to the autoimmune and inflammatory processes that characterize RA. While RA can have dermatological manifestations, such as rheumatoid nodules or vasculitis, these are not caused by chemical exposure. Therefore, having a chemical-induced dermatological disorder does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Autoimmune vasculitis,4146124,False,"No.

Autoimmune vasculitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While autoimmune vasculitis can occur in patients with RA, it is not exclusive to RA and can be seen in a variety of other autoimmune and systemic inflammatory conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis), and microscopic polyangiitis, among others. Therefore, the presence of autoimmune vasculitis does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Episcleritis,4218083,False,"No.

Episcleritis is an inflammation of the episclera, a thin layer of tissue covering the white part of the eye (sclera). While episcleritis can be associated with autoimmune conditions, including Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Episcleritis can occur in the context of other systemic inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease, and even in the absence of any systemic disease. Therefore, having episcleritis does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Subcutaneous nodule,4316084,False,"No.

Subcutaneous nodules are not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While subcutaneous nodules, also known as rheumatoid nodules, can occur in patients with RA, they are not exclusive to this condition. These nodules can also be seen in other diseases and conditions, such as gout, sarcoidosis, and certain infections. Therefore, the presence of subcutaneous nodules does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Juvenile chronic arthritis,4079731,False,"No.

Juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA), also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), is a different condition from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While both are forms of arthritis and share some similarities, such as being autoimmune diseases that cause joint inflammation, they are distinct entities with different diagnostic criteria and patient populations. JCA/JIA specifically refers to arthritis that begins in childhood, whereas RA typically affects adults.

Having juvenile chronic arthritis does not mean that one definitely has rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the condition of juvenile chronic arthritis is not specific to the malady of rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of wrist,42872407,False,"No.

Arthritis of the wrist is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While wrist arthritis can be a symptom of RA, it can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, or even trauma. Therefore, having arthritis of the wrist does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Arthritis of hip,4286642,False,"No.

Arthritis of the hip is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in any joint, including the hip, arthritis of the hip can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases. Therefore, having arthritis of the hip does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Myopathy due to rheumatoid arthritis,4107913,False,"No.

Rationale:
Myopathy due to rheumatoid arthritis refers to muscle disease or muscle weakness that can occur as a complication of rheumatoid arthritis. While myopathy can be associated with RA, it is not specific to RA. Myopathy can result from various other conditions, including other autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorders, infections, and certain medications. Therefore, having myopathy does not definitively indicate that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthropathy of left knee joint,36676836,False,"No.

Arthropathy of the left knee joint refers to any disease of the joint, which can include a wide range of conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, septic arthritis, or even trauma-related arthritis. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can certainly cause arthropathy in the knee joint, the presence of arthropathy in the left knee alone is not specific to RA. Other conditions can also cause similar joint issues. Therefore, having arthropathy of the left knee joint does not definitively indicate that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,72705,False,"No.

Pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), also known as oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that affects four or fewer joints during the first six months of disease. It primarily affects children and is distinct from adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in several ways, including its age of onset, pattern of joint involvement, and potential for different systemic manifestations.

While both conditions are types of inflammatory arthritis and share some similarities, pauciarticular JRA is specific to a pediatric population and has different diagnostic criteria and clinical features compared to adult RA. Therefore, having pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis does not definitively mean that one has rheumatoid arthritis as described in the provided malady description, which pertains to adult-onset RA."
Occupational lung disease,4312754,False,"No.

Occupational lung disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Occupational lung diseases are a group of conditions caused by exposure to harmful substances in the workplace, such as dust, chemicals, or fumes, leading to respiratory issues. These conditions include asbestosis, silicosis, coal worker's pneumoconiosis, and others.

While RA is primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the joints, it can have systemic manifestations, including lung involvement (e.g., interstitial lung disease). However, the presence of an occupational lung disease does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. Occupational lung diseases can occur independently of RA and are related to environmental exposures rather than autoimmune mechanisms.

Therefore, having an occupational lung disease does not mean that a person definitely has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of right knee joint,36676837,False,"No.

Arthropathy of the right knee joint refers to any disease of the joint, which can include a wide range of conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, septic arthritis, or trauma-related arthritis, among others. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can certainly cause arthropathy in the knee joint, the presence of arthropathy in the right knee alone is not specific to RA. 

RA typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis, meaning it affects multiple joints on both sides of the body, particularly the small joints of the hands and feet. A diagnosis of RA is based on a combination of clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings. Therefore, having arthropathy in a single joint, such as the right knee, does not definitively indicate RA, as it could be due to various other joint diseases.

In summary, while arthropathy of the right knee joint can be a manifestation of RA, it is not specific to RA, as it can occur in many other conditions."
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,4259507,False,"No.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While both conditions are types of arthritis and share some similarities, they are distinct entities. JIA is a term used to describe arthritis that begins before the age of 16 and persists for more than six weeks, with no identifiable cause. It encompasses several subtypes, including systemic JIA, oligoarticular JIA, and polyarticular JIA, among others.

RA, on the other hand, typically affects adults and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, serological markers like rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, and specific imaging findings. While JIA can present with similar symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, it is a separate diagnosis with its own criteria and subtypes.

Therefore, having JIA does not mean that one definitely has RA, making JIA not specific to RA."
Skin necrosis,4317266,False,"No.

Skin necrosis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can have various extra-articular manifestations, including skin involvement, skin necrosis is not a hallmark or defining feature of RA. Skin necrosis can result from a variety of conditions, including but not limited to severe infections, vascular diseases, trauma, and other autoimmune conditions. Therefore, the presence of skin necrosis does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Periostitis,440822,False,"No.

Periostitis is an inflammation of the periosteum, a layer of connective tissue that surrounds bone. It can be caused by various factors, including infection, injury, or repetitive stress. While periostitis can occur in the context of several conditions, including infections, trauma, and other inflammatory diseases, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While RA can lead to various types of bone and joint complications, periostitis is not a hallmark or specific feature of RA. Therefore, the presence of periostitis does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Undifferentiated inflammatory polyarthritis,4218311,False,"No, undifferentiated inflammatory polyarthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

Rationale:
Undifferentiated inflammatory polyarthritis refers to a condition where a patient has inflammation in multiple joints, but the specific type of arthritis has not yet been determined. This condition can be a precursor to several types of arthritis, including RA, but it is not exclusive to RA. Other potential diagnoses that can present with undifferentiated inflammatory polyarthritis include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriatic arthritis, and other autoimmune or inflammatory conditions.

Therefore, while undifferentiated inflammatory polyarthritis can be an early manifestation of RA, it is not specific to RA because it can also be associated with other diseases."
Vasculitis of the skin,4182711,False,"No.

Vasculitis of the skin, which involves inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin, is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While vasculitis can occur in patients with RA, it is not exclusive to this condition. Vasculitis can be associated with a variety of other diseases, including other autoimmune disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), infections, and even certain medications. Therefore, the presence of vasculitis of the skin does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Cervical arthritis,4300489,False,"No.

Cervical arthritis, also known as cervical spondylosis, is a condition that affects the cervical spine (the neck region) and is typically associated with age-related wear and tear of the spinal discs and joints. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can affect the cervical spine, particularly the atlantoaxial joint, cervical arthritis can also occur due to other reasons such as osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, or other non-inflammatory conditions.

Therefore, having cervical arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has RA. Cervical arthritis can be seen in a variety of conditions, not just RA."
Necrotizing vasculitis,4039691,False,"No.

Necrotizing vasculitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While necrotizing vasculitis can occur in patients with RA, it is not exclusive to RA and can be seen in a variety of other conditions, including other autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), infections, and certain drug reactions. Therefore, the presence of necrotizing vasculitis does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Acute polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,75621,False,"No.

Acute polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is a specific subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), which is a different condition from adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While both conditions share some similarities, such as being autoimmune diseases that affect the joints, they are distinct entities with different diagnostic criteria, age of onset, and clinical management.

Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis specifically refers to arthritis that begins in childhood, typically before the age of 16, and can present in various forms, including oligoarticular, polyarticular, and systemic. Acute polyarticular JRA involves five or more joints within the first six months of disease onset and can be either rheumatoid factor-positive or negative.

Rheumatoid arthritis, as described, is an adult-onset condition with its own set of diagnostic criteria and clinical features. Therefore, having acute polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis does not definitively mean that one has rheumatoid arthritis, as they are separate conditions."
Systemic onset juvenile chronic arthritis,4116447,False,"No.

Systemic onset juvenile chronic arthritis (also known as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis or Still's disease) is a distinct condition from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While both are types of inflammatory arthritis and share some overlapping features, they are different diseases with different diagnostic criteria and patient populations.

Systemic onset juvenile chronic arthritis typically presents in children and is characterized by systemic symptoms such as fever, rash, and inflammation of internal organs, in addition to arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, primarily affects adults and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet, along with serological markers like rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies.

Therefore, having systemic onset juvenile chronic arthritis does not mean that one definitely has rheumatoid arthritis. They are separate conditions with distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria."
Polyneuropathy in rheumatoid arthritis,4102493,False,"No.

Polyneuropathy is a condition that involves damage to multiple peripheral nerves and can manifest as numbness, tingling, pain, and weakness, often in the hands and feet. While polyneuropathy can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Polyneuropathy can be caused by a variety of other conditions, including diabetes, infections, toxins, and other autoimmune diseases.

In the context of RA, polyneuropathy may develop as a complication due to chronic inflammation, vasculitis, or as a side effect of certain medications used to treat RA. However, the presence of polyneuropathy does not definitively indicate that a person has RA, as it can occur independently of RA or in association with other diseases.

Therefore, while polyneuropathy can be associated with RA, it is not specific to RA."
Spondylitis,4223530,False,"No.

Spondylitis, specifically ankylosing spondylitis, is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine, although other joints can also be involved. It is characterized by inflammation of the vertebrae that can lead to severe, chronic pain and discomfort. In advanced cases, this inflammation can lead to new bone formation on the spine, causing sections of the spine to fuse in a fixed, immobile position.

While both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis are types of inflammatory arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different primary sites of involvement and different clinical features. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly the small joints of the hands and feet, and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints.

Therefore, having spondylitis does not mean that a person definitely has rheumatoid arthritis. The two conditions are separate entities with different diagnostic criteria and clinical presentations."
Inflammation of joint of foot,40489492,False,"No.

Inflammation of the joint of the foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause inflammation in the joints of the feet, this condition can also be seen in various other maladies, such as osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, and other forms of inflammatory arthritis. Therefore, the presence of inflammation in the joint of the foot does not definitively indicate RA, as it could be due to a number of other conditions."
Arthritis of acromioclavicular joint,4323882,False,"No.

Arthritis of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can affect any synovial joint, including the AC joint, arthritis in the AC joint can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, or other inflammatory arthritides. Therefore, the presence of arthritis in the AC joint does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Mass of elbow region,761926,False,"No.

A mass in the elbow region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause swelling and deformities in various joints, including the elbow, a mass in the elbow region could be due to a variety of other conditions such as bursitis, lipoma, ganglion cyst, or even a tumor. Therefore, the presence of a mass in the elbow region does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Acute rheumatic endocarditis,437897,False,"No.

Acute rheumatic endocarditis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Acute rheumatic endocarditis is a manifestation of acute rheumatic fever, which is a sequela of a streptococcal infection, typically Group A Streptococcus. It primarily affects the heart valves and is part of the broader spectrum of rheumatic heart disease.

Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by chronic inflammation, joint pain, and deformities. While RA can have systemic manifestations and can affect the heart (e.g., pericarditis, myocarditis), acute rheumatic endocarditis is not a condition that is specifically associated with RA.

Therefore, having acute rheumatic endocarditis does not mean that a person definitely has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis,4025168,False,"No.

Diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (DIPF) is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While DIPF can occur in patients with RA as a manifestation of rheumatoid lung disease, it is not exclusive to RA. DIPF can also be associated with other conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and other connective tissue diseases. Therefore, having DIPF does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Ankle joint inflamed,4182009,False,"No.

Rationale: While inflammation of the ankle joint can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Ankle joint inflammation can be caused by a variety of other conditions, including but not limited to osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and even trauma or infection. Therefore, the presence of an inflamed ankle joint does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Arthritis of joint of toe,4176008,False,"No.

Arthritis of the joint of the toe is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can indeed cause arthritis in the joints of the toes, arthritis in the toe joints can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, and other forms of inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases. Therefore, having arthritis in the joint of the toe does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Bilateral arthropathy of knee joints,36687055,False,"No.

Bilateral arthropathy of the knee joints refers to a condition where both knee joints are affected by a disease process, which could involve inflammation, degeneration, or other pathological changes. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can certainly cause bilateral arthropathy of the knee joints, this condition is not specific to RA. 

Bilateral arthropathy of the knee joints can be seen in various other conditions, including but not limited to:
- Osteoarthritis (OA), which is a degenerative joint disease.
- Psoriatic arthritis, another type of inflammatory arthritis.
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that can affect joints.
- Gout, which can cause joint inflammation due to uric acid crystal deposition.
- Infectious arthritis, which can affect multiple joints including the knees.

Therefore, while bilateral arthropathy of the knee joints can be a feature of RA, it is not specific to RA. If a patient has bilateral arthropathy of the knee joints, they do not definitely have RA, as this condition can be seen in a variety of other diseases as well."
Monarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,75622,False,"No.

Monarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) when it affects a single joint, is a specific subtype of juvenile arthritis that typically affects children. While it shares some similarities with adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as being an autoimmune condition that causes joint inflammation, it is distinct in several ways:

1. **Age of Onset**: JRA/JIA occurs in children, whereas RA typically affects adults.
2. **Joint Involvement**: Monarticular JRA/JIA affects a single joint, whereas RA is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, usually involving multiple joints.
3. **Disease Course and Prognosis**: The course and prognosis of JRA/JIA can differ significantly from adult RA. Some children with JRA/JIA may outgrow the condition, while RA is generally a lifelong condition.

Given these differences, having monarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis does not definitively mean that one has rheumatoid arthritis as defined in adults. Therefore, the condition is not specific to the malady of rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of temporomandibular joint,4240648,False,"No.

Arthritis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can occur in various forms of arthritis, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can indeed affect the TMJ, it is not specific to RA. Other types of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, can also involve the TMJ. Therefore, the presence of arthritis in the TMJ does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Arthritis of right elbow,37119224,False,"No.

Arthritis of the right elbow is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in any joint, including the right elbow, arthritis in a single joint can also be caused by a variety of other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, septic arthritis, or trauma. Therefore, having arthritis in the right elbow does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. RA typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis, meaning it affects multiple joints on both sides of the body, particularly the small joints of the hands and feet."
Inflammation of joint of left hand,759887,False,"No.

Inflammation of a joint in the left hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA commonly affects the small joints of the hands and can cause inflammation, joint inflammation in the hand can also be caused by a variety of other conditions, such as osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, or even an injury or infection. Therefore, having inflammation in a joint of the left hand does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Inflammation of joint of right hand,759888,False,"No.

Inflammation of a joint in the right hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA commonly affects the small joints of the hands and can cause inflammation, joint inflammation in the hand can also be caused by a variety of other conditions, such as osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, infectious arthritis, or even trauma. Therefore, having inflammation in a joint of the right hand does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Drug-induced lesion,4005650,False,"No.

A drug-induced lesion is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Drug-induced lesions can occur as a side effect of various medications and can be associated with a wide range of conditions, not just RA. For example, certain medications used to treat infections, cancer, or other autoimmune diseases can also cause drug-induced lesions. Therefore, the presence of a drug-induced lesion does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Finger joint inflamed,4185033,False,"No.

While finger joint inflammation can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Inflammation of the finger joints can occur in various other conditions, including osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and even infections or trauma. Therefore, having inflamed finger joints does not definitively mean that a person has RA. It is one of the symptoms that could suggest RA, but further clinical evaluation, serological tests, and imaging studies are necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
Arthritis of left foot,37108613,False,"No.

Arthritis of the left foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in the small joints of the feet, including the left foot, arthritis in the left foot alone can be caused by a variety of other conditions as well. These conditions include osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, and other forms of inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases. Therefore, having arthritis in the left foot does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Arthritis of right foot,37117139,False,"No.

Arthritis of the right foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in the joints of the feet, including the right foot, arthritis in a single joint or a specific location like the right foot can also be caused by a variety of other conditions. These include osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, and other forms of inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases. Therefore, having arthritis in the right foot does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Autoimmune leukopenia,4051056,False,"No.

Autoimmune leukopenia is a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys white blood cells, leading to a reduced white blood cell count. While autoimmune disorders can coexist and leukopenia can be seen in various autoimmune diseases, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). 

RA is primarily characterized by chronic inflammation of the synovial joints, and its diagnosis is based on clinical criteria such as joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings. Autoimmune leukopenia can occur in a variety of autoimmune conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and other hematologic disorders, but it is not a defining or specific feature of RA. Therefore, having autoimmune leukopenia does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Arthritis of right ankle,37108614,False,"No.

Arthritis of the right ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in any joint, including the right ankle, arthritis in a single joint can also be caused by a variety of other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, septic arthritis, or trauma. Therefore, having arthritis in the right ankle does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Arthritis of right wrist,37108607,False,"No, arthritis of the right wrist is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

Rationale:
Arthritis of the right wrist can be caused by various conditions, not just RA. While RA can certainly cause arthritis in the wrist, other forms of arthritis such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and even traumatic arthritis can also affect the wrist. Therefore, having arthritis in the right wrist does not definitively mean that a person has RA. It is a symptom that could be associated with multiple different arthritic conditions."
Arthritis of left ankle,37108612,False,"No.

Arthritis of the left ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in any joint, including the left ankle, arthritis in a single joint can also be caused by a variety of other conditions. These include osteoarthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, septic arthritis, and other forms of inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases. Therefore, having arthritis in the left ankle does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Rheumatoid lung disease with rheumatoid arthritis,37395590,False,"No.

Rationale: Rheumatoid lung disease is a condition that can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but it is not specific to RA. While rheumatoid lung disease is associated with RA and can be a complication of it, having rheumatoid lung disease does not definitively mean that a person has RA. There are other conditions and factors that can lead to lung disease, and not all patients with RA will develop rheumatoid lung disease. Therefore, the presence of rheumatoid lung disease with rheumatoid arthritis is not specific to RA."
Arthritis of left glenohumeral joint,37108602,False,"No.

Arthritis of the left glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can affect any synovial joint, including the glenohumeral joint, arthritis in this joint can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, or other inflammatory arthritides like psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, the presence of arthritis in the left glenohumeral joint does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Metatarsophalangeal joint inflamed,4179147,False,"No.

While inflammation of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. MTP joint inflammation can be seen in various other conditions, including gout, psoriatic arthritis, and osteoarthritis. Therefore, having an inflamed MTP joint does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Arthritis of left elbow,37108605,False,"No.

Arthritis of the left elbow is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in any joint, including the elbow, arthritis in a single joint (such as the left elbow) can also be caused by a variety of other conditions. These include osteoarthritis, gout, septic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and trauma, among others. Therefore, having arthritis in the left elbow does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Subtalar joint inflamed,4179146,False,"No.

The subtalar joint, located in the foot, can become inflamed due to various conditions, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can indeed cause inflammation in the subtalar joint as part of its systemic involvement of multiple joints, inflammation in this specific joint is not exclusive to RA. Other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, trauma, or even infections can also lead to inflammation of the subtalar joint. Therefore, having an inflamed subtalar joint does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Arthritis of left wrist,37108606,False,"No.

Arthritis of the left wrist is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in the wrist, including the left wrist, arthritis in a single joint can also be caused by a variety of other conditions. These include osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, infectious arthritis, and other forms of inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases. Therefore, having arthritis in the left wrist does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Inflammation of joint of both hands,765257,False,"No.

While inflammation of the joints of both hands is a common symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. This condition can also be seen in other types of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), among others. Therefore, having inflammation of the joints of both hands does not definitively mean that a person has RA; it could be indicative of several different types of arthritis or other inflammatory conditions."
Arthritis of right glenohumeral joint,37108603,False,"No.

Arthritis of the right glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can affect the shoulder joints, arthritis in the glenohumeral joint can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, or other inflammatory arthritides like psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, having arthritis in the right glenohumeral joint does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Interphalangeal joint of toe inflamed,4184092,False,"No.

While inflammation of the interphalangeal joint of the toe can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. This condition can also be seen in other forms of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and other inflammatory or infectious conditions. Therefore, having an inflamed interphalangeal joint of the toe does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Metacarpophalangeal joint inflamed,4185032,False,"No.

While inflammation of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints is a common symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Other conditions, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), can also cause inflammation in the MCP joints. Therefore, having an inflamed MCP joint does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Arthritis of midtarsal joint,4322886,False,"No.

Arthritis of the midtarsal joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can affect any joint in the body, including the midtarsal joint, arthritis in this specific joint can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, or other inflammatory arthritides like gout or psoriatic arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis of the midtarsal joint does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Bilateral arthritis of feet,37108616,False,"No.

Rationale: Bilateral arthritis of the feet can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but it is not specific to RA. Other conditions, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and gout, can also present with bilateral arthritis of the feet. Therefore, while bilateral arthritis of the feet may suggest the presence of RA, it does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Deformity of hand due to rheumatoid arthritis,46273442,False,"**No**

Rationale: While a deformity of the hand can be a consequence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA alone. Deformities in the hand can result from other conditions as well, such as osteoarthritis, trauma, or other inflammatory arthritides. Therefore, having a hand deformity does not definitively mean that a person has RA. However, if a person has RA, they may develop hand deformities as the disease progresses. Thus, the condition of having a hand deformity due to RA is not specific to RA, as it can occur in other maladies as well."
Arthritis of right hip,759890,False,"No.

Arthritis of the right hip is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in any joint, including the hip, arthritis of the right hip alone can be due to a variety of other conditions such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, septic arthritis, or even trauma. Therefore, having arthritis in the right hip does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Deformity of foot due to rheumatoid arthritis,4334806,False,"No.

Rationale: While a deformity of the foot due to rheumatoid arthritis is a condition that can occur in individuals with RA, it is not specific to RA. This means that having a foot deformity due to RA does not definitively indicate that a person has RA, as foot deformities can also result from other conditions such as osteoarthritis, trauma, or other types of inflammatory arthritis. Therefore, the presence of a foot deformity alone is not sufficient to diagnose RA without considering other clinical criteria and diagnostic markers specific to RA."
Anterior uveitis due to juvenile idiopathic arthritis,4211939,False,"No.

Anterior uveitis is an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye, specifically the uvea, and it can be associated with various systemic conditions, including juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). While anterior uveitis is a known complication of JIA, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). 

RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, joint swelling, and tenderness. Although RA can have extra-articular manifestations, anterior uveitis is not a common or specific feature of RA. 

Therefore, the presence of anterior uveitis due to juvenile idiopathic arthritis does not definitively indicate that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral arthritis of ankle,37108615,False,"No.

Rationale: Bilateral arthritis of the ankle can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but it is not specific to RA. Bilateral arthritis of the ankle can also be seen in other conditions such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and other inflammatory or infectious arthritides. Therefore, while bilateral arthritis of the ankle may suggest the presence of RA, it is not definitive for RA, as it can occur in other diseases as well."
Dilated cardiomyopathy due to rheumatoid arthritis,4060405,False,"No.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition characterized by the dilation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles of the heart, leading to heart failure. While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can have various extra-articular manifestations, including cardiovascular complications, DCM is not specific to RA. 

In other words, while RA can potentially lead to cardiovascular issues, including DCM, having DCM does not definitively mean that a person has RA. DCM can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic predisposition, viral infections, alcohol abuse, and other systemic diseases. Therefore, the presence of DCM does not specifically indicate that a person has RA."
Inflammation of joints of bilateral shoulder regions,759886,False,"No.

Inflammation of the joints in the bilateral shoulder regions is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can indeed cause inflammation in the shoulder joints, this condition can also be seen in a variety of other disorders, including but not limited to osteoarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, rotator cuff injuries, and other inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases. Therefore, the presence of inflammation in the bilateral shoulder joints does not definitively indicate RA, as it could be due to several other conditions."
Arthropathy of multiple joints,762446,False,"No.

Arthropathy of multiple joints refers to a condition involving disease of the joints, which can be caused by a variety of underlying issues, including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While RA is a common cause of polyarticular arthropathy, other conditions such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and infectious arthritis can also present with arthropathy of multiple joints. Therefore, having arthropathy of multiple joints does not definitively indicate that a person has RA, as it could be due to other forms of arthritis or joint disease."
Arthritis of left hip,759889,False,"No.

Arthritis of the left hip is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in any joint, including the hip, arthritis of the left hip alone can be due to a variety of other conditions, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, septic arthritis, or even trauma. Therefore, having arthritis in the left hip does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Deformity of wrist due to rheumatoid arthritis,4330635,True,"Yes.

Rationale: A deformity of the wrist due to rheumatoid arthritis is a specific condition that indicates the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. If a person has a wrist deformity that is explicitly attributed to rheumatoid arthritis, it means they definitely have rheumatoid arthritis. This is because the deformity is a direct consequence of the joint destruction and damage caused by the chronic inflammatory process of RA. However, not all individuals with rheumatoid arthritis will necessarily have a wrist deformity, as the severity and progression of the disease can vary widely among patients. Therefore, while wrist deformity due to RA confirms the presence of RA, having RA does not guarantee the presence of wrist deformity."
Infective arthritis of right hip,42534830,False,"No.

Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is an infection in a joint that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It is characterized by joint pain, swelling, redness, and fever, and it typically requires prompt medical treatment to prevent joint damage.

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune condition that primarily affects the synovial joints, leading to chronic inflammation, joint pain, and deformities. While RA can increase the risk of infections, including infective arthritis, the presence of infective arthritis of the right hip does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. Infective arthritis can occur independently of RA and can affect individuals without any underlying autoimmune conditions.

Therefore, having infective arthritis of the right hip does not mean that a person definitely has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deformity of left foot co-occurrent and due to rheumatoid arthritis,42534841,False,"No.

Rationale: While a deformity of the left foot can occur due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Deformities in the foot can result from various other conditions, including osteoarthritis, trauma, congenital abnormalities, and other inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, having a deformity of the left foot does not definitively indicate that a person has RA, even though RA can cause such deformities."
Deformity of right foot co-occurrent and due to rheumatoid arthritis,42534840,True,"Yes.

Rationale: A deformity of the right foot that is co-occurrent and due to rheumatoid arthritis is a specific condition that indicates the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. If a patient has a deformity of the right foot that is explicitly stated to be due to rheumatoid arthritis, it confirms the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. This is because the deformity is a direct consequence of the joint destruction and damage caused by the chronic inflammatory process of RA. Therefore, having this specific condition means the patient definitely has rheumatoid arthritis."
Deformity of left hand co-occurrent and due to rheumatoid arthritis,42534839,True,"Yes.

Rationale: The condition ""Deformity of left hand co-occurrent and due to rheumatoid arthritis"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). If a patient has a deformity of the left hand that is co-occurring and due to RA, it definitively indicates the presence of RA. This is because the deformity is directly attributed to the RA, which is known to cause joint destruction and deformities as part of its disease process. Therefore, having this specific condition means the patient definitely has RA."
Bilateral arthritis of elbows,42534863,False,"No.

Rationale:
While bilateral arthritis of the elbows can be a manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Bilateral arthritis of the elbows can also occur in other conditions such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, having bilateral arthritis of the elbows does not definitively mean that a person has RA. It is one of the possible presentations but not exclusive to RA."
Bilateral arthritis of wrist,37108608,False,"No.

While bilateral arthritis of the wrist can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Bilateral arthritis of the wrist can also be seen in other conditions such as osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and other inflammatory or autoimmune disorders. Therefore, having bilateral arthritis of the wrist does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Arthritis of left knee,759891,False,"No.

Arthritis of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in any joint, including the knee, arthritis of the left knee alone can be due to a variety of other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, septic arthritis, or even trauma. Therefore, having arthritis in the left knee does not definitively mean that a person has RA. RA typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis, meaning it affects multiple joints on both sides of the body, particularly the small joints of the hands and feet. Thus, arthritis in a single joint, such as the left knee, is not specific to RA."
Bilateral arthritis of knees,759892,False,"No.

Bilateral arthritis of the knees is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can certainly cause bilateral arthritis in the knees, this condition can also be seen in other types of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and even in some cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, having bilateral arthritis of the knees does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Acute polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,42535150,False,"No.

Acute polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that affects five or more joints within the first six months of disease onset in children. While both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and polyarticular JIA are autoimmune conditions that involve multiple joints, they are distinct entities. RA primarily affects adults and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, whereas polyarticular JIA affects children and can present with different clinical features and disease courses.

The presence of acute polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis does not definitively indicate that a person has rheumatoid arthritis. Although both conditions share similarities, such as joint inflammation and potential for joint damage, they are diagnosed based on different criteria and affect different age groups. Therefore, having acute polyarticular JIA does not mean that one definitely has RA."
Rheumatoid linear subcutaneous bands,4299307,False,"No.

Rheumatoid linear subcutaneous bands, also known as rheumatoid nodules, are firm lumps that can form under the skin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While these nodules are associated with RA and can be a sign of the disease, they are not specific to RA. This means that their presence does not definitively indicate that a person has RA, as they can also occur in other conditions or even in the absence of RA. Therefore, having rheumatoid linear subcutaneous bands does not mean that a person definitely has rheumatoid arthritis."
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of right knee,37204149,False,"No.

Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), is a different condition from adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While both conditions are types of inflammatory arthritis and share some similarities, they are distinct entities with different diagnostic criteria, age of onset, and potentially different pathophysiological mechanisms.

Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis specifically refers to arthritis that begins in children under the age of 16 and can affect any joint, including the knee. It is not specific to adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis, which typically begins in adulthood and has a different clinical course and management.

Therefore, having juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of the right knee does not definitively mean that one has rheumatoid arthritis as described in the provided malady description."
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of left knee,37204148,False,"No.

Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), is a different condition from adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While both conditions are types of inflammatory arthritis and share some similarities, they are distinct entities with different diagnostic criteria, age of onset, and potentially different pathophysiological mechanisms.

JRA specifically refers to arthritis that begins in childhood, typically before the age of 16, and can present in various forms, including oligoarticular, polyarticular, and systemic. The involvement of the left knee in JRA does not necessarily mean that the individual has adult-onset RA. Therefore, having juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of the left knee does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis as described in the provided malady description."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left hand,36686060,False,"No.

The presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue in the left hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While subcutaneous nodules, known as rheumatoid nodules, can occur in RA patients, they are not exclusive to RA and can be seen in other conditions as well. For example, subcutaneous nodules can also be found in conditions such as gout, sarcoidosis, and even in some infections or benign conditions like lipomas.

Therefore, having a subcutaneous nodule in the left hand does not definitively indicate that a person has RA. It is one of the possible manifestations but not specific enough to confirm the diagnosis of RA on its own."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left upper limb,36686056,False,"No.

Rationale: A nodule of subcutaneous tissue in the left upper limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While subcutaneous nodules, known as rheumatoid nodules, can occur in RA patients, they are not exclusive to RA and can be seen in other conditions as well. For example, subcutaneous nodules can also be found in conditions such as gout, sarcoidosis, and certain infections. Therefore, the presence of a subcutaneous nodule in the left upper limb does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral hands,36686055,False,"No.

Rationale:
While subcutaneous nodules, also known as rheumatoid nodules, can be a feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), they are not specific to RA. These nodules are firm lumps that typically occur over pressure points such as the elbows, fingers, and hands. However, they can also be seen in other conditions, such as gout, sarcoidosis, and even in some infections or malignancies. Therefore, the presence of subcutaneous nodules in the bilateral hands does not definitively indicate RA, as they can occur in other diseases as well. Thus, having this condition does not mean that one definitely has RA."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral upper limbs,36686052,False,"No.

Rationale:
While subcutaneous nodules can be a feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), they are not specific to RA. Subcutaneous nodules, also known as rheumatoid nodules, are firm lumps that can occur under the skin, often near joints affected by RA. However, these nodules can also be seen in other conditions, such as gout, sarcoidosis, and certain infections. Therefore, the presence of subcutaneous nodules in the bilateral upper limbs does not definitively indicate RA, as they can occur in other diseases as well. Thus, having this condition does not mean that one definitely has RA."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right hand,36686072,False,"No.

A nodule of subcutaneous tissue in the right hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While subcutaneous nodules, known as rheumatoid nodules, can occur in RA, they are not exclusive to this condition. Such nodules can also be seen in other conditions, including gout, sarcoidosis, and even infections or benign growths. Therefore, the presence of a subcutaneous nodule in the right hand does not definitively indicate RA, although it could be a feature of the disease."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right upper limb,36686068,False,"No.

A nodule of subcutaneous tissue in the right upper limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While subcutaneous nodules, known as rheumatoid nodules, can occur in RA patients, they are not exclusive to RA and can be seen in other conditions as well. For example, subcutaneous nodules can also be found in conditions such as gout, sarcoidosis, and certain infections. Therefore, the presence of a subcutaneous nodule in the right upper limb does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Bilateral temporomandibular joint arthritis,36687163,False,"No.

Bilateral temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis can occur in various conditions, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can indeed affect the temporomandibular joints, it is not the only condition that can cause arthritis in these joints. Other conditions, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, can also lead to TMJ arthritis. Therefore, the presence of bilateral TMJ arthritis is not specific to RA, as it does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Arthritis of left temporomandibular joint,36687162,False,"No.

Arthritis of the left temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can indeed affect the temporomandibular joint, arthritis in this joint can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, trauma, infection, or other inflammatory diseases. Therefore, having arthritis in the left temporomandibular joint does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Arthritis of right temporomandibular joint,36687161,False,"No.

Arthritis of the right temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can affect the TMJ, arthritis in this joint can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, trauma, infection, or other inflammatory diseases. Therefore, having arthritis in the right TMJ does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Bilateral deformity of wrists due to rheumatoid arthritis,37309723,False,"No.

Rationale: While bilateral deformity of the wrists can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to the chronic inflammation and joint damage characteristic of the disease, it is not specific to RA. This means that while many patients with RA may develop bilateral wrist deformities, the presence of such deformities alone does not definitively indicate RA. Other conditions, such as advanced osteoarthritis or other inflammatory arthritides, could also potentially lead to wrist deformities. Therefore, the condition of bilateral deformity of the wrists due to rheumatoid arthritis is not specific to RA."
Bilateral deformity of feet due to rheumatoid arthritis,37309722,False,"No.

Rationale: While bilateral deformity of the feet can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to the chronic inflammation and joint damage associated with the disease, it is not specific to RA. Other conditions, such as severe osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or even certain congenital deformities, can also lead to bilateral foot deformities. Therefore, the presence of bilateral deformity of the feet does not definitively indicate that a person has RA, even though it can be a consequence of the disease."
Bilateral deformity of hands due to rheumatoid arthritis,37309724,False,"No.

Rationale: While bilateral deformity of the hands can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to the chronic inflammation and joint damage characteristic of the disease, it is not specific to RA. Other conditions, such as severe osteoarthritis or certain genetic disorders, can also cause deformities in the hands. Therefore, having bilateral deformity of the hands does not definitively mean that a person has RA, even though it is a common manifestation in advanced cases of the disease."
Deformity of right hand co-occurrent and due to rheumatoid arthritis,42534838,True,"Yes.

A deformity of the right hand that is co-occurrent and due to rheumatoid arthritis is specific to rheumatoid arthritis. This is because such deformities are a direct consequence of the chronic inflammation and joint destruction caused by RA. If a patient has a hand deformity specifically attributed to RA, it indicates that the underlying cause is indeed rheumatoid arthritis. While other conditions can cause hand deformities, the specification that it is ""due to rheumatoid arthritis"" makes it specific to RA."
Arthritis of right knee,765259,False,"No.

Arthritis of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can cause arthritis in any joint, including the knee, arthritis of the right knee alone can be due to a variety of other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, septic arthritis, or trauma. Therefore, having arthritis in the right knee does not definitively indicate that a person has RA."
Bilateral arthritis of hip,765258,False,"No.

Rationale: Bilateral arthritis of the hip can be a manifestation of several different conditions, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA can indeed affect the hips, it is not specific to RA. Other conditions such as osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases can also cause bilateral arthritis of the hip. Therefore, having bilateral arthritis of the hip does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Spindling of fingers of bilateral hands due to rheumatoid arthritis,3654567,False,"No.

Spindling of the fingers, also known as ""spindle-shaped"" fingers, is a condition that can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) due to chronic inflammation and joint damage. However, it is not specific to RA. While it is a characteristic feature that can be seen in RA, it can also be observed in other conditions that cause chronic joint inflammation and deformities, such as psoriatic arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, the presence of spindle-shaped fingers does not definitively indicate that a person has RA, as it could be due to other inflammatory arthritides."
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of bilateral knees,37209479,False,"No.

Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), is a different condition from adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While both conditions share similarities, such as being autoimmune diseases that cause joint inflammation, they are distinct entities with different diagnostic criteria, age of onset, and sometimes different clinical features.

Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis specifically refers to arthritis that begins in children under the age of 16 and can present in various forms, including oligoarticular (affecting a few joints), polyarticular (affecting many joints), and systemic (affecting the whole body). The involvement of bilateral knees is a specific presentation within the spectrum of JRA/JIA.

Therefore, having juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of bilateral knees does not definitively mean that the person has adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis. The two conditions, while related, are not the same, and the presence of one does not confirm the presence of the other."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of hand,36684273,False,"No.

A nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the hand, often referred to as a rheumatoid nodule, can be associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but it is not specific to RA. Rheumatoid nodules are firm lumps that typically occur in areas subjected to pressure, such as the elbows, fingers, and hands, and are seen in some patients with RA. However, similar nodules can also be found in other conditions, such as gout, sarcoidosis, and granuloma annulare. Therefore, the presence of a subcutaneous nodule in the hand does not definitively indicate RA, even though it can be a feature of the disease."
