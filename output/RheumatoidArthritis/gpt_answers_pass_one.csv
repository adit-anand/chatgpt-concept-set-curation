Additionally, the presence of bilateral arthritis of knees can be a key clinical criteria for diagnosing RA."
Acute polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,42535150,True,"Yes, acute polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a group of chronic inflammatory diseases affecting children under the age of 16. Acute polyarticular JIA is a subtype of JIA characterized by inflammation in five or more joints within the first six months of disease onset. This condition shares similarities with Rheumatoid Arthritis in terms of joint involvement, swelling, and tenderness. Additionally, both conditions are autoimmune disorders that can lead to joint damage and deformities if left untreated. Therefore, if a patient has acute polyarticular JIA, they definitely have a form of arthritis that is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rheumatoid linear subcutaneous bands,4299307,False,"No

Rheumatoid linear subcutaneous bands are not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While they can be seen in some patients with RA, they are not a defining characteristic of the disease. These bands are fibrous tissue that can develop under the skin in patients with longstanding RA, but they can also be seen in other conditions such as scleroderma. Therefore, the presence of rheumatoid linear subcutaneous bands does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of right knee,37204149,True,"Yes, the condition ""Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of right knee"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a type of arthritis that affects children under the age of 16 and can involve one or more joints, including the knee. In this case, the specific mention of rheumatoid arthritis in the condition indicates that the patient has been diagnosed with RA affecting the right knee. Since RA is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet, the presence of RA in the right knee would be indicative of the overall disease. Therefore, if a patient has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of the right knee, they definitely have the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of left knee,37204148,True,"Yes, the condition ""Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of left knee"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a subtype of RA that affects children. The specific mention of ""left knee"" in the condition indicates joint involvement, which is a key feature of RA. Additionally, the term ""juvenile"" in the condition suggests an early onset of the disease, which is characteristic of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, if a person has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of the left knee, they definitely have the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left hand,36686060,False,"No, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left hand"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition and can be present in other diseases as well. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue in the left hand does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to make a diagnosis of RA."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left upper limb,36686056,False,"No, a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the left upper limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition. Nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or even benign conditions like lipomas. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the left upper limb alone is not enough to definitively diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral hands,36686055,True,"Yes, the condition of nodules of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral hands is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are a common extra-articular manifestation of RA, typically found in areas of pressure or trauma such as the hands. These nodules are firm, non-tender, and can vary in size. Therefore, if a patient presents with nodules of subcutaneous tissue in the bilateral hands, it strongly suggests the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral upper limbs,36686052,False,"No, the condition of ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral upper limbs"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition and can be present in other diseases such as gout or granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right upper limb,36686068,False,"No, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right upper limb"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition. Nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and rheumatoid nodules can also be seen in conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the right upper limb does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral temporomandibular joint arthritis,36687163,True,"Yes, bilateral temporomandibular joint arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the synovial joints, including the temporomandibular joint. Bilateral temporomandibular joint arthritis, which refers to inflammation and damage in both temporomandibular joints, is a common manifestation of RA. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral temporomandibular joint arthritis, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left temporomandibular joint,36687162,False,"No, arthritis of the left temporomandibular joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including the temporomandibular joint, arthritis of the temporomandibular joint can be caused by various factors such as trauma, osteoarthritis, or other inflammatory conditions. Therefore, having arthritis of the left temporomandibular joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right temporomandibular joint,36687161,False,"No, arthritis of the right temporomandibular joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the hands and feet, arthritis of the temporomandibular joint is a separate condition that affects the jaw joint. It is more commonly associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis or trauma to the joint. Therefore, having arthritis of the right temporomandibular joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral deformity of wrists due to rheumatoid arthritis,37309723,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral deformity of wrists due to rheumatoid arthritis is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. This is because bilateral deformity of wrists is a characteristic feature of advanced Rheumatoid Arthritis, where chronic inflammation and joint destruction lead to deformities in the affected joints. Therefore, if a person has bilateral deformity of wrists, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral deformity of feet due to rheumatoid arthritis,37309722,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral deformity of feet due to rheumatoid arthritis is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. This is because the description of Rheumatoid Arthritis includes joint deformities as a characteristic feature of the disease. In RA, chronic inflammation and destruction of the joints can lead to deformities, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, if a person has bilateral deformity of the feet due to RA, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral deformity of hands due to rheumatoid arthritis,37309724,True,"Yes, the condition ""Bilateral deformity of hands due to rheumatoid arthritis"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is known to cause joint deformities, particularly in the small joints of the hands. The presence of bilateral deformities in the hands is a classic manifestation of advanced Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral deformities of the hands, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deformity of right hand co-occurrent and due to rheumatoid arthritis,42534838,True,"Yes, the condition of deformity of the right hand co-occurring and due to rheumatoid arthritis is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is known to cause joint deformities, particularly in the hands and feet, due to the chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints. The description of the malady specifically mentions that RA can lead to deformities and functional impairment. Therefore, if a patient has a deformity of the right hand that is attributed to rheumatoid arthritis, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right knee,765259,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of right knee"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In Rheumatoid Arthritis, joint involvement is typically symmetric, meaning that if one knee is affected, the other knee is likely to be affected as well. Additionally, the description of Rheumatoid Arthritis mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are consistent with arthritis in the knee joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the right knee, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral arthritis of hip,765258,True,"Yes, bilateral arthritis of the hip can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric, meaning that both sides of the body are affected equally. Bilateral arthritis of the hip fits this pattern of symmetric polyarthritis seen in RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are all characteristics that can be present in bilateral arthritis of the hip in RA. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral arthritis of the hip, it is likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Spindling of fingers of bilateral hands due to rheumatoid arthritis,3654567,True,"Yes, the condition of spindling of fingers of bilateral hands is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This is because spindling of fingers, also known as fusiform swelling, is a characteristic feature of RA due to the inflammation and destruction of the joints in the hands. It is a classic finding in RA and is not typically seen in other forms of arthritis such as osteoarthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Therefore, if a patient presents with spindling of fingers of bilateral hands, it strongly suggests the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of bilateral knees,37209479,True,"Yes, the condition of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of bilateral knees is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, which means that it affects multiple joints on both sides of the body. The condition of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of bilateral knees fits this description as it involves inflammation and arthritis in both knees, which is consistent with the symmetric joint involvement seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, the presence of arthritis in the knees is a common manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, particularly in juvenile cases. 

Therefore, if a person has been diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis of bilateral knees, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of hand,36684273,True,"Yes, a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the hand can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are a common extra-articular manifestation of RA, typically found in areas of pressure or trauma, such as the hands. These nodules are firm, non-tender, and can be mobile or fixed. While not all patients with RA will develop rheumatoid nodules, the presence of these nodules can be a strong indicator of RA in a patient with other clinical features of the disease. Therefore, if a patient has a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
