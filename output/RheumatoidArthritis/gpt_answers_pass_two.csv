Skin nodule,4319300,False,"No, a skin nodule is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While skin nodules can be a rare manifestation of RA known as rheumatoid nodules, they are not present in all cases of RA. Skin nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout, granuloma annulare, or even certain infections. Therefore, the presence of a skin nodule alone does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Injury of articular cartilage of left knee joint,36686378,False,"No, the condition ""Injury of articular cartilage of left knee joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint damage can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis, an injury to the articular cartilage of the left knee joint can be caused by various factors such as trauma, overuse, or other forms of arthritis like osteoarthritis. Therefore, having an injury of the articular cartilage of the left knee joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Injury of articular cartilage of right knee joint,36686377,False,"No, the condition ""Injury of articular cartilage of right knee joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint damage can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis, an injury to the articular cartilage of the right knee joint could be caused by a variety of factors such as trauma, overuse, or other forms of arthritis like osteoarthritis. It is important to consider the specific symptoms, clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis when making a diagnosis."
Autoimmune skin disease,4319304,False,"No

Rationale: The presence of an autoimmune skin disease does not specifically indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. While autoimmune diseases can sometimes coexist, having an autoimmune skin disease does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in this case."
Acute lymphangitis of hand,4171828,False,"No

Rationale: Acute lymphangitis of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute lymphangitis is an infection of the lymphatic vessels, typically caused by bacteria entering through a break in the skin. It presents with red streaks on the skin, swelling, warmth, and tenderness along the affected lymphatic vessels. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop acute lymphangitis as a secondary infection, having acute lymphangitis of the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Palmar erythema,4210765,False,"No

Rationale:
Palmar erythema is a condition characterized by redness of the palms of the hands. While palmar erythema can be associated with various conditions such as liver disease, pregnancy, and certain medications, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having palmar erythema does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Stress fracture of lateral condyle of left femur,759834,False,"No

Rationale:
A stress fracture of the lateral condyle of the left femur is a specific injury related to the femur bone, typically caused by repetitive stress or overuse. It is not a symptom or characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may be at increased risk for fractures due to osteoporosis or medication side effects, a stress fracture of the femur is not a direct manifestation of RA itself."
Recurrent dislocation of joint,81939,False,"No

Rationale: Recurrent dislocation of a joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint deformities and functional impairment can occur in RA, recurrent dislocation of a joint can be caused by various factors such as ligament laxity, trauma, or anatomical abnormalities. It is not a defining characteristic of RA and can be seen in other conditions or situations unrelated to RA."
Climacteric arthritis of the shoulder region,81938,False,"No.

Rationale:
Climacteric arthritis of the shoulder region is a specific condition related to degenerative changes in the shoulder joint that occur with age, particularly in postmenopausal women. While it may cause joint pain and stiffness in the shoulder region, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The two conditions have different etiologies and pathophysiology, so having climacteric arthritis of the shoulder region does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Skin necrosis,4317266,False,"No, skin necrosis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Skin necrosis refers to the death of skin tissue, which can be caused by various factors such as trauma, infection, vascular issues, or medication side effects. While skin necrosis can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having skin necrosis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of ankle,36684347,False,"No

Rationale: Tendinitis of the ankle is a condition characterized by inflammation of the tendons in the ankle, which can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the affected joint. While tendinitis can be a symptom of rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Tendinitis can also be caused by other factors such as overuse, injury, or other inflammatory conditions. Therefore, having tendinitis of the ankle does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Rheumatoid factor negative,4014120,True,"Yes, the condition ""Rheumatoid factor negative"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Rheumatoid factor (RF) is an autoantibody commonly found in the blood of patients with RA. However, approximately 20-30% of patients with RA are negative for RF. Therefore, if a patient is Rheumatoid factor negative, they may still have RA. This condition is not specific to any other malady and is commonly seen in patients with RA."
Degenerative disorder of cartilage,4180010,False,"No

Rationale:
While degenerative disorder of cartilage can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint destruction and deformities, it is not specific to RA. Degenerative disorders of cartilage can also be seen in other conditions such as osteoarthritis. Therefore, having a degenerative disorder of cartilage does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Palindromic rheumatism of multiple sites,81945,True,"Yes, palindromic rheumatism of multiple sites can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Palindromic rheumatism is a rare form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent episodes of joint pain, swelling, and stiffness that resolve spontaneously within a few days. While palindromic rheumatism is not exclusive to Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is considered a precursor to RA in some cases. Studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients with palindromic rheumatism eventually develop RA. Therefore, if a patient presents with palindromic rheumatism of multiple sites, it may indicate an increased risk of developing Rheumatoid Arthritis in the future."
Post-infective arthritis of joint of hand,4313176,False,"No

Rationale:
Post-infective arthritis of the joint of the hand is a specific condition that occurs after an infection in the joint. While it can cause symptoms similar to rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease with specific diagnostic criteria, including serological markers and imaging findings, which are not necessarily present in post-infective arthritis. Therefore, having post-infective arthritis of the joint of the hand does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Acute lymphangitis of buttock,4225116,False,"No

Rationale: Acute lymphangitis of the buttock is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute lymphangitis is an infection of the lymphatic vessels, typically caused by bacteria entering through a break in the skin. It is characterized by red streaks on the skin, swelling, warmth, and tenderness. This condition is not a known symptom or diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective polyarthritis,4266078,False,"No, infective polyarthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective polyarthritis refers to joint inflammation caused by an infectious agent such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi. While Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by autoimmune inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints, infective polyarthritis is caused by an infection. Therefore, having infective polyarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Transient arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot,79905,False,"No

Rationale: Transient arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot is a temporary joint condition affecting the ankle and/or foot. While it may cause symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and a transient arthropathy would not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Additional diagnostic criteria such as serological markers and imaging findings would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of RA."
Systemic vasculitis,4264033,False,"No

Rationale:
Systemic vasculitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Systemic vasculitis is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation and damage to blood vessels, which can affect various organs in the body. While vasculitis can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis as a complication, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having systemic vasculitis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Elbow joint inflamed,4184090,True,"Yes, the condition ""Elbow joint inflamed"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint inflammation is a key feature, and it commonly affects multiple joints, including the elbows. The presence of inflammation in the elbow joint would be consistent with the inflammatory nature of RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are all characteristics that could lead to inflammation in the elbow joint. Therefore, if someone has an inflamed elbow joint, it is likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Shoulder joint inflamed,4184089,False,"No, the condition ""shoulder joint inflamed"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint inflammation is a common symptom of RA, it can also be caused by a variety of other conditions such as osteoarthritis, bursitis, tendonitis, or even an injury. In order to determine if the shoulder joint inflammation is due to RA, further evaluation including clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be necessary."
Osteoarthritis of finger joint,4343918,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis of the finger joint is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While osteoarthritis can affect the finger joints, it is a distinct condition from rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the finger joint does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Disorder of skull,4040720,False,"No, a disorder of the skull is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While RA can affect joints throughout the body, it does not specifically target the skull. A disorder of the skull may be related to other conditions such as trauma, infections, or tumors, but it is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Subcutaneous sarcoidosis,4214896,False,"No

Rationale: Subcutaneous sarcoidosis is a specific condition that involves the formation of nodules or plaques under the skin due to the inflammatory response characteristic of sarcoidosis. While sarcoidosis is an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis, subcutaneous sarcoidosis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having subcutaneous sarcoidosis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Juvenile arthritis in ulcerative colitis,4114447,False,"No.

Rationale:
Juvenile arthritis is a term used to describe arthritis that occurs in individuals under the age of 16. While juvenile arthritis can be associated with autoimmune conditions like ulcerative colitis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings that differentiate it from other types of arthritis, including juvenile arthritis. Therefore, having juvenile arthritis in the setting of ulcerative colitis does not definitively mean that the individual has rheumatoid arthritis."
Wrist joint deformity,4198513,True,"Yes, wrist joint deformity is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint deformities are a common manifestation due to the chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints. Wrist joint deformity is often seen in advanced stages of RA and is a result of the progressive damage to the joint structures. Therefore, if a patient presents with wrist joint deformity, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of joint of spine,4157453,True,"Yes, a disorder of the joint of the spine could be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the spine. Symptoms of RA can include joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, which can also affect the joints of the spine. Therefore, if someone has a disorder of the joint of the spine, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acrokerato-elastoidosis,4007950,False,"No, acrokerato-elastoidosis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acrokerato-elastoidosis is a rare skin disorder characterized by small, firm papules on the hands and feet. It is a dermatological condition and not directly related to the joint inflammation and autoimmune process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have acrokerato-elastoidosis, the presence of acrokerato-elastoidosis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of immune function,440371,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of immune function"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, there are many other autoimmune disorders and conditions that fall under the category of ""Disorder of immune function."" Therefore, having a disorder of immune function does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of adductor pollicis,4001797,True,"Yes, contracture of adductor pollicis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction can lead to deformities and functional impairment, including contractures. The adductor pollicis muscle is located in the hand and is commonly affected in RA, leading to contractures that can impact hand function. Therefore, if a patient has contracture of adductor pollicis, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gluteal tendinitis,4239487,False,"No

Rationale: Gluteal tendinitis is inflammation of the tendons in the gluteal muscles, typically causing pain and tenderness in the buttock area. While gluteal tendinitis can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Gluteal tendinitis can also be seen in other conditions such as hip bursitis or overuse injuries. Therefore, having gluteal tendinitis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Dilated cardiomyopathy,4163710,False,"No, Dilated cardiomyopathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While there have been some reported cases of cardiac involvement in patients with RA, dilated cardiomyopathy is a separate condition characterized by the enlargement of the heart chambers and impaired heart function. It can be caused by various factors such as genetics, infections, toxins, and certain medications. Therefore, having dilated cardiomyopathy does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous and articular syndrome",4079739,False,"No, the condition ""Chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous and articular syndrome"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition is actually a rare autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent fevers, skin rashes, and joint pain in infants and young children. While joint pain is a symptom shared with Rheumatoid Arthritis, the other features of this syndrome are not typically seen in RA. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease,4079736,False,"No, juvenile arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile arthritis can be a separate condition that affects children and is characterized by joint inflammation, while inflammatory bowel disease is a separate condition that affects the gastrointestinal tract. While there may be some overlap in symptoms and potential autoimmune mechanisms, having juvenile arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in this case."
Synovitis of elbow,4079737,True,"Yes, synovitis of the elbow can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis, which is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, is a common feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is typically symmetric and affects multiple joints, including the elbows. Therefore, if a patient presents with synovitis of the elbow, it could be a sign of Rheumatoid Arthritis, although further evaluation and diagnostic criteria would be needed to confirm the diagnosis."
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis with psoriasis,4079734,True,"Yes, the condition ""Juvenile psoriatic arthritis with psoriasis"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile psoriatic arthritis with psoriasis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) that involves both arthritis and psoriasis in children. Psoriatic arthritis is an autoimmune condition that affects the joints and skin, similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, psoriatic arthritis can also involve the skin, nails, and eyes. 

Given that psoriatic arthritis is an autoimmune condition that shares similarities with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is possible for a patient with Juvenile psoriatic arthritis with psoriasis to also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has Juvenile psoriatic arthritis with psoriasis, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile spondyloarthropathy,4079735,False,"No, juvenile spondyloarthropathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile spondyloarthropathy is a group of inflammatory diseases that primarily affect the spine and large joints, and it can also involve the skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract. While both conditions are autoimmune inflammatory disorders, they have distinct clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having juvenile spondyloarthropathy does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Early onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis,4079732,True,"Yes, early onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Early onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis refers to a type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) that affects fewer than five joints in the first six months of disease onset. This condition is considered a subtype of JIA and is associated with a higher risk of developing Rheumatoid Arthritis later in life. Therefore, if a person has early onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis, they are at an increased risk of developing Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis,4079733,True,"Yes, juvenile psoriatic arthritis is specific to rheumatoid arthritis.

Rationale:
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis is a type of arthritis that occurs in children and is associated with the skin condition psoriasis. It is characterized by joint inflammation, pain, and stiffness, similar to rheumatoid arthritis. However, juvenile psoriatic arthritis is specifically linked to psoriasis, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, if a patient has juvenile psoriatic arthritis, they definitely have a form of arthritis, but not necessarily rheumatoid arthritis. On the other hand, if a patient has rheumatoid arthritis, they may or may not have juvenile psoriatic arthritis."
Bursitis of lower limb,46273161,False,"No

Rationale: Bursitis of the lower limb is inflammation of the bursae, which are small fluid-filled sacs that cushion and lubricate areas where tendons, muscles, and bones rub together. While bursitis can cause joint pain and swelling in the affected area, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Bursitis can be caused by repetitive movements, injury, or underlying conditions such as osteoarthritis, and it does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA."
Osteoarthritis of right glenohumeral joint,759879,False,"No.

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage of the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. It is different from rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right glenohumeral joint does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Mass of elbow region,761926,False,"No

Rationale: A mass of the elbow region is a nonspecific symptom that can be caused by a variety of conditions, including but not limited to ganglion cysts, lipomas, bursitis, or even tumors. While joint swelling and deformities are common symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis, a mass in the elbow region alone is not specific enough to definitively diagnose RA. Further evaluation, including physical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory tests, would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the mass."
Disorder of toe,4028528,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of toe"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the toes, a disorder of the toe could be caused by various other conditions such as trauma, infection, gout, or osteoarthritis. Therefore, having a disorder of the toe does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to determine the underlying cause of the toe disorder."
Acute infective polyarthritis,4034672,False,"No, acute infective polyarthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute infective polyarthritis refers to joint inflammation caused by an infection, such as a bacterial or viral infection. While joint inflammation is a common symptom in both conditions, acute infective polyarthritis is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, the underlying cause of acute infective polyarthritis is an infection, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by autoimmune inflammation. Therefore, having acute infective polyarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune leukopenia,4051056,False,"No, autoimmune leukopenia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Autoimmune leukopenia refers to a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys white blood cells, leading to a decrease in the number of these cells in the blood. While autoimmune conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis can be associated with abnormalities in the immune system, autoimmune leukopenia is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other factors and diagnostic criteria when assessing a patient for Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pyogenic bacterial polyarthritis,761945,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic bacterial polyarthritis is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic bacterial polyarthritis refers to a bacterial infection in multiple joints, which can present with symptoms similar to RA such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. However, the presence of pyogenic bacterial polyarthritis indicates an infectious etiology, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder. Therefore, if a patient has pyogenic bacterial polyarthritis, they definitely do not have RA."
Pyogenic bacterial arthritis of foot,761944,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the foot is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic bacterial arthritis is a type of infectious arthritis caused by bacteria entering the joint space, leading to inflammation and joint damage. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are at an increased risk of developing infections, including pyogenic bacterial arthritis, due to their compromised immune system and the chronic inflammation present in their joints. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops pyogenic bacterial arthritis in their foot, it is highly likely that it is a complication of their underlying Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Partial failure replanted fingers,4309010,False,"No

Rationale: The condition of partial failure of replanted fingers is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition refers to a surgical procedure where a severed finger is reattached to the hand. Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and the symptoms and diagnostic criteria for RA do not include partial failure of replanted fingers."
Small vessel vasculitis,37110370,True,"Yes, small vessel vasculitis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Small vessel vasculitis is a known extra-articular manifestation of RA, where inflammation affects the small blood vessels in various organs, leading to symptoms such as skin rashes, nerve damage, and kidney problems. Therefore, if a patient with RA presents with small vessel vasculitis, it is highly likely that the two conditions are related."
Osteitis of thigh,4094059,False,"No, osteitis of the thigh is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteitis refers to inflammation of the bone, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, trauma, or other inflammatory conditions. While joint involvement and inflammation are common features of Rheumatoid Arthritis, osteitis of the thigh is a more general term that does not specifically point to RA. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests would be needed to determine if osteitis of the thigh is related to Rheumatoid Arthritis or another underlying condition."
Total failure replanted finger,4309014,False,"No

Rationale: A total failure of a replanted finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition refers to a surgical procedure where a severed finger is reattached to the hand. Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and the presence of a total failure replanted finger does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA."
Post-infective polyarthritis,4173925,False,"No

Rationale: Post-infective polyarthritis is a condition that occurs after an infection, typically a viral or bacterial infection, and is characterized by joint pain and swelling in multiple joints. While the symptoms of post-infective polyarthritis may be similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis, the underlying cause is different. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, whereas post-infective polyarthritis is a reactive arthritis that occurs in response to an infection. Therefore, having post-infective polyarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Synovial osteochondromatosis of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger,4067425,False,"No

Rationale: Synovial osteochondromatosis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger is a benign condition characterized by the formation of multiple cartilaginous nodules within the synovial membrane of joints. While this condition may cause joint swelling and stiffness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having synovial osteochondromatosis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger does not definitively mean that an individual has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic infective arthritis,4163680,False,"No, chronic infective arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chronic infective arthritis refers to a persistent infection in a joint, which can lead to chronic inflammation and joint damage. While both conditions can cause joint swelling and pain, chronic infective arthritis is caused by an infection, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease. The presence of chronic infective arthritis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nevus striatus symmetricus of thumbs,4034652,False,"No, nevus striatus symmetricus of thumbs is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Nevus striatus symmetricus is a rare benign condition characterized by a linear streak of hyperpigmentation on the thumbs. It is a dermatological condition and not related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that is Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may have nevus striatus symmetricus of thumbs, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovial osteochondromatosis of sternoclavicular joint,4067421,False,"No.

Rationale:
Synovial osteochondromatosis of the sternoclavicular joint is a benign condition characterized by the formation of multiple cartilaginous nodules within the synovial lining of the joint. While this condition may cause joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having synovial osteochondromatosis of the sternoclavicular joint does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of hand due to viral infection,4178008,False,"No

Rationale: Arthritis of the hand due to a viral infection is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and presents with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, arthritis of the hand due to a viral infection is a different condition caused by a viral pathogen affecting the joints. The presence of arthritis in the hand due to a viral infection does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Photodermatitis co-occurrent and due to autoimmune disease,42537710,True,"Yes, photodermatitis co-occurring and due to an autoimmune disease can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Photodermatitis is a condition where the skin becomes inflamed and irritated after exposure to sunlight. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, photosensitivity can be a symptom due to the underlying autoimmune process. Additionally, some medications used to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis, such as certain DMARDs and biologic agents, can also increase sensitivity to sunlight and lead to photodermatitis. Therefore, if a patient has photodermatitis co-occurring and due to an autoimmune disease, it is likely specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Relapsing polychondritis,4216873,True,"Yes, relapsing polychondritis is specific to rheumatoid arthritis.

Rationale:
Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation and destruction of cartilage in the body, including the ears, nose, and respiratory tract. While relapsing polychondritis can affect various parts of the body, including joints, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast, rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having relapsing polychondritis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis, but having rheumatoid arthritis may increase the risk of developing relapsing polychondritis."
Tuberculosis of peripheral lymph nodes,432236,False,"No

Rationale:
Tuberculosis of peripheral lymph nodes is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can present with systemic symptoms, they are distinct entities with different etiologies and pathophysiology. Tuberculosis of peripheral lymph nodes is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, leading to the formation of granulomas in the lymph nodes, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having tuberculosis of peripheral lymph nodes does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Palmar pit,4083790,True,"Yes, a palmar pit is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Palmar pits are small depressions or pits in the palms of the hands that can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. These pits are a characteristic finding in RA and are thought to be related to the underlying inflammatory process affecting the skin. Therefore, if a patient has palmar pits, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Localized, primary osteoarthritis of the shoulder region",73840,False,"No

Rationale: Localized, primary osteoarthritis of the shoulder region is a specific condition that refers to degenerative joint disease affecting the shoulder joint. While osteoarthritis can present with joint pain and stiffness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having localized, primary osteoarthritis of the shoulder region does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Joint ankylosis of the shoulder region,73845,True,"Yes, joint ankylosis of the shoulder region is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Joint ankylosis refers to the immobility or fusion of a joint, which can occur in advanced stages of RA due to joint destruction and deformities. In RA, joint ankylosis can affect various joints, including the shoulder region. Therefore, if a patient presents with joint ankylosis of the shoulder region, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of respiratory system due to microscopic polyangiitis,606332,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of respiratory system due to microscopic polyangiitis"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While respiratory involvement can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Microscopic polyangiitis is a separate condition that primarily affects the small blood vessels and can lead to inflammation in various organs, including the respiratory system. Therefore, having a disorder of the respiratory system due to microscopic polyangiitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pyogenic bacterial arthritis of wrist,761982,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the wrist is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic bacterial arthritis is an infection of the joint caused by bacteria, leading to joint inflammation, pain, and swelling. While both conditions can present with joint swelling and tenderness, the presence of a bacterial infection in the joint would not be a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the wrist, they definitely do not have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Median nerve neuritis,4071499,False,"No, median nerve neuritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Median nerve neuritis refers to inflammation of the median nerve, which can cause symptoms such as pain, numbness, and weakness in the hand and fingers. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can cause inflammation in the joints, it is not specifically associated with inflammation of the median nerve. Median nerve neuritis can be caused by various factors such as repetitive use injuries, trauma, or compression of the nerve, and is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Polyarthropathy,75897,True,"Yes, polyarthropathy can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Polyarthropathy refers to inflammation involving multiple joints, which is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, the inflammation typically affects multiple joints symmetrically, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient presents with polyarthropathy, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis as one of the potential underlying causes. However, it is important to consider other differential diagnoses and perform further evaluations to confirm the diagnosis of RA."
Monoarthritis of wrist,44784339,False,"No

Rationale: Rheumatoid Arthritis typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, whereas monoarthritis of the wrist refers to inflammation in only one joint. While monoarthritis of the wrist can be a symptom of RA, it is not specific to the malady as it can also be caused by other conditions such as trauma, infection, or crystal arthropathies. Therefore, having monoarthritis of the wrist does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of hand,44784338,True,"Yes, monoarthritis of the hand can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands. Monoarthritis of the hand, which refers to inflammation in only one joint of the hand, may not be specific to RA as it can be seen in other conditions such as trauma, infection, or crystal arthropathies. However, in the context of RA, monoarthritis of the hand can be a manifestation of the disease, especially in the early stages before it progresses to involve multiple joints. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of RA in this case."
Synovitis of ankle,764017,True,"Yes, synovitis of the ankle can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, which is a characteristic feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is a key component of the disease process, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient has synovitis of the ankle, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis, although further evaluation and diagnostic criteria would need to be considered for a definitive diagnosis."
Infective arthritis of interphalangeal joint of toe,40489491,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Infective arthritis of interphalangeal joint of toe"" refers to a specific type of arthritis caused by an infection in the interphalangeal joint of the toe. While this condition may present with similar symptoms such as joint pain and swelling, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and the presence of infective arthritis in a specific joint does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Additional diagnostic criteria such as serological markers and imaging findings are necessary to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of skin of hand,4177988,False,"No, contracture of the skin of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Contracture of the skin of the hand refers to a tightening or shortening of the skin, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as scarring, burns, or trauma. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and presents with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, contracture of the skin of the hand is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having contracture of the skin of the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of ankle and/or foot,44784341,False,"No, monoarthritis of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet, monoarthritis (inflammation of a single joint) of the ankle and/or foot can be caused by various other conditions such as gout, septic arthritis, osteoarthritis, or trauma. Therefore, having monoarthritis of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of elbow,44784340,False,"No

Rationale: While monoarthritis of the elbow can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to this malady. Monoarthritis of the elbow can also be caused by other conditions such as trauma, infection, gout, or other forms of arthritis. Therefore, having monoarthritis of the elbow does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Paget's disease-metacarpal,4001980,False,"No, Paget's disease of the metacarpal bones is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Paget's disease is a chronic bone disorder characterized by abnormal bone remodeling, leading to enlarged and weakened bones. It primarily affects the pelvis, spine, skull, and long bones of the legs, but can also involve the metacarpal bones in the hands. While both conditions can affect the bones, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder, whereas Paget's disease is a disorder of bone remodeling. Therefore, having Paget's disease of the metacarpal bones does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Fibroblastic rheumatism,4266181,False,"No, fibroblastic rheumatism is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Fibroblastic rheumatism is a rare condition characterized by skin nodules and joint contractures, which is distinct from the typical presentation of rheumatoid arthritis involving synovial joint inflammation and destruction. While both conditions may involve joint symptoms, the underlying pathophysiology and clinical features are different, making fibroblastic rheumatism not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Cyst of finger,4335814,False,"No, a cyst of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A cyst of the finger is a fluid-filled sac that can develop in the tissues of the fingers, typically near a joint or tendon. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can cause joint swelling and deformities in the fingers, a cyst of the finger is a separate condition that can occur for various reasons unrelated to RA, such as trauma or repetitive use of the fingers. Therefore, having a cyst of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pathological dislocation of ankle and/or foot,77956,False,"No

Rationale: Pathological dislocation of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can lead to joint deformities and damage, pathological dislocation of the ankle and/or foot can be caused by various other conditions such as trauma, congenital abnormalities, or other forms of arthritis. Therefore, having a pathological dislocation of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Injury of hand,80004,False,"No, an injury of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling in the hands, an injury of the hand can occur in anyone regardless of whether they have RA or not. Injuries can result from trauma, accidents, overuse, or other factors unrelated to RA. Therefore, having an injury of the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral wrist osteoarthritis,36684458,False,"No, bilateral wrist osteoarthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While wrist involvement can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis, bilateral wrist osteoarthritis is more commonly associated with osteoarthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA. Osteoarthritis is characterized by joint pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion, typically affecting weight-bearing joints such as the knees, hips, and spine. In contrast, Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having bilateral wrist osteoarthritis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Palmoplantar sarcoidosis,3655857,False,"No, palmoplantar sarcoidosis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Palmoplantar sarcoidosis is a rare cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin. While both conditions can present with joint symptoms, palmoplantar sarcoidosis primarily affects the skin of the palms and soles, causing nodules, plaques, or ulcers. In contrast, Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having palmoplantar sarcoidosis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of joint of bilateral hands,36684457,False,"No, osteoarthritis of the joint of bilateral hands is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis can affect the hands, they have different underlying causes and pathophysiology. Osteoarthritis is primarily a wear-and-tear condition, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the joint of bilateral hands does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ganglion of hand,4182198,False,"No, a ganglion of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A ganglion is a noncancerous lump that most commonly occurs on the wrist or hand, typically near a joint or tendon. It is caused by leakage of fluid from the joint or tendon sheath, leading to the formation of a cyst. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, a ganglion is a separate entity and not a defining characteristic of RA."
Bilateral osteoarthritis of knees,36684454,False,"No.

Rationale:
While bilateral osteoarthritis of the knees can present with joint pain and swelling, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the articular cartilage, leading to joint pain and stiffness. It is not an autoimmune disorder like rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the description of rheumatoid arthritis specifically mentions symmetric polyarthritis, which is not a characteristic feature of osteoarthritis. Therefore, having bilateral osteoarthritis of the knees does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Achilles tendinitis,77963,False,"No, Achilles tendinitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Achilles tendinitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the Achilles tendon, which connects the calf muscles to the heel bone. It is typically caused by overuse or repetitive strain on the tendon. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop Achilles tendinitis as a secondary complication due to the inflammatory nature of RA affecting multiple joints and tendons, Achilles tendinitis can also occur in individuals without RA. Therefore, having Achilles tendinitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune keratitis,36717242,False,"No, autoimmune keratitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Autoimmune keratitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the cornea due to an autoimmune response, which can be caused by various autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren's syndrome, among others. Therefore, while autoimmune keratitis can be associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to this malady as it can be present in other autoimmune conditions as well."
Disorder of body wall,4266188,False,"No, a disorder of the body wall is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, a disorder of the body wall could refer to a variety of conditions such as muscle strains, hernias, or skin conditions. It is important to consider the specific symptoms and diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis when assessing whether a condition is specific to this malady."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis",4253902,True,"Yes, Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that primarily affects the entheses, which are the sites where tendons and ligaments attach to bones. While this condition primarily affects children and adolescents, it shares some similarities with adult-onset Rheumatoid Arthritis in terms of joint inflammation and autoimmune involvement. Therefore, if a patient has been diagnosed with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, not all patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis will have Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis, as RA can present in various forms and subtypes."
Left foot neuritis,42535449,False,"No

Rationale: Neuritis refers to inflammation of a nerve, which can cause symptoms such as pain, tingling, or numbness. While neuritis can occur in various conditions, including autoimmune diseases like RA, it is not specific to RA. Left foot neuritis could be caused by a variety of factors, such as nerve compression, injury, or other medical conditions. Therefore, having left foot neuritis does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Right foot neuritis,42535448,False,"No

Rationale: Right foot neuritis is a condition involving inflammation of the nerves in the right foot, which can cause symptoms such as pain, tingling, and numbness in the affected area. While these symptoms can be present in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), right foot neuritis is not specific to RA. Neuritis can be caused by various factors such as trauma, compression, infection, or other autoimmune conditions. Therefore, having right foot neuritis does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Osteitis condensans of medial clavicle,3655845,False,"No

Rationale: Osteitis condensans of the medial clavicle is a benign condition characterized by sclerosis of the medial end of the clavicle, typically seen in women of childbearing age. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a separate and distinct condition with different etiology, presentation, and management. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially have osteitis condensans of the medial clavicle, the presence of osteitis condensans of the medial clavicle does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of tendon of right hand,36684476,False,"No, a disorder of the tendon of the right hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not specifically target tendons. Tendon disorders can be caused by a variety of factors such as overuse, injury, or inflammatory conditions like tenosynovitis, which are not exclusive to RA. Therefore, having a disorder of the tendon of the right hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of tendon of left hand,36684475,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of tendon of left hand"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not specifically target tendons. Tendon disorders can be caused by various factors such as overuse, injury, or inflammatory conditions like tenosynovitis, but they are not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having a disorder of the tendon of the left hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Dislocation of scapulothoracic joint,4135079,False,"No, dislocation of the scapulothoracic joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Dislocation of the scapulothoracic joint refers to the displacement of the scapula from its normal position on the thoracic wall. This is typically caused by trauma or overuse injuries, rather than being directly associated with RA. While RA can lead to joint deformities and damage, dislocation of the scapulothoracic joint is not a common manifestation of RA."
Herpes gestationis,4311256,False,"No, herpes gestationis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Herpes gestationis, also known as pemphigoid gestationis, is a rare autoimmune skin disorder that occurs during pregnancy or postpartum. It is characterized by the development of itchy, blistering skin lesions that typically start on the abdomen and spread to other parts of the body. While both conditions are autoimmune in nature, they affect different systems in the body (skin vs. joints) and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having herpes gestationis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Extensor carpi radialis tenosynovitis,4344024,False,"No, extensor carpi radialis tenosynovitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Extensor carpi radialis tenosynovitis is a condition involving inflammation of the tendon sheath of the extensor carpi radialis muscles in the forearm, typically causing pain and swelling at the wrist. While it can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not exclusive to this condition and can occur in individuals without RA as well. Therefore, having extensor carpi radialis tenosynovitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Extension deformity of finger,4069538,True,"Yes, extension deformity of the finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction and deformities are common due to chronic inflammation and damage to the synovial joints. Extension deformities of the fingers, also known as boutonniere deformities, can occur in RA as a result of tendon damage and joint destruction. Therefore, if a patient presents with extension deformity of the finger, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic polyarthritis,3168431,True,"Yes, chronic polyarthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chronic polyarthritis, which is the presence of arthritis in multiple joints for an extended period of time, is a key feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, the arthritis is typically symmetric and affects multiple joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a person has chronic polyarthritis, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital absence of soft tissue of distal phalanx of finger,764073,False,"No, the condition ""Congenital absence of soft tissue of distal phalanx of finger"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition refers to a congenital anomaly involving the soft tissue of the finger, which is unrelated to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that characterizes RA. While individuals with RA may experience joint deformities and damage, this specific congenital anomaly is not a defining feature of the disease."
Abscess of tendon sheath of right ankle and/or foot,764072,False,"No, the condition ""Abscess of tendon sheath of right ankle and/or foot"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. An abscess of the tendon sheath is a localized infection that can occur in any individual, regardless of whether they have RA or not. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not necessarily predispose individuals to developing abscesses in the tendon sheath. Therefore, having an abscess of the tendon sheath does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of left hip joint,36713109,False,"No, osteoarthritis of the left hip joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While both osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis are types of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Osteoarthritis is primarily a wear-and-tear condition affecting the joints, while Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left hip joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Laxity of ligaments of foot,4344036,False,"No

Rationale: Laxity of ligaments of the foot is a condition that can occur in various situations, such as in individuals with hypermobility syndromes or previous injuries. While it may be present in some individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the chronic inflammatory nature of the disease affecting the joints, it is not specific to RA. Therefore, having laxity of ligaments of the foot does not definitively mean that an individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of right hip joint,36713110,False,"No, osteoarthritis of the right hip joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While both osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis are types of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Osteoarthritis is primarily due to wear and tear on the joints over time, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune condition. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right hip joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Villous arthritis of hand,764076,False,"No.

Rationale:
Villous arthritis of the hand is not a specific condition or term recognized in medical literature. It is possible that this term may be a misinterpretation or miscommunication of a different condition. However, based on the description provided for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), there is no mention of a specific condition called ""villous arthritis of the hand"" that is characteristic or specific to RA. Therefore, the presence of villous arthritis of the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of right knee joint,36713111,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is different from rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right knee joint does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Developmental dislocation of joint of shoulder region,40479438,False,"No

Rationale: Developmental dislocation of the joint of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is not specifically associated with developmental dislocation of the shoulder joint. This condition is more commonly seen in conditions such as congenital disorders or traumatic injuries."
Rheumatic fever nodule,4344041,False,"No, a rheumatic fever nodule is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatic fever nodules are subcutaneous nodules that can develop in patients with acute rheumatic fever, which is a complication of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis. These nodules are typically found over bony prominences and are not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, the presence of a rheumatic fever nodule does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle,4176016,True,"Yes, arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Behcet's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis that can affect multiple organ systems, including the joints. Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome can present similarly to RA with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. However, the key difference is that Behcet's syndrome is not primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints like RA. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle, they may also have RA, but having RA does not necessarily mean they have Behcet's syndrome."
Discoid meniscus of right knee,764093,False,"No

Rationale:
A discoid meniscus of the right knee is a structural abnormality of the knee joint where the meniscus is abnormally shaped, often larger and thicker than usual. This condition can lead to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and catching or locking of the knee joint. While a discoid meniscus can cause knee pain and dysfunction, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and destruction. Therefore, having a discoid meniscus of the right knee does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Discoid meniscus of left knee,764092,False,"No

Rationale:
A discoid meniscus of the left knee is a structural abnormality of the knee joint where the meniscus is abnormally shaped, often larger and thicker than usual. While this condition can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and clicking in the knee joint, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and deformities. Therefore, having a discoid meniscus of the left knee does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Peroneal tendinitis of left lower limb,36713095,False,"No

Rationale: Peroneal tendinitis is a condition involving inflammation of the peroneal tendons in the lower limb, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may experience joint pain and inflammation in various parts of the body, peroneal tendinitis is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having peroneal tendinitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of subcutaneous tissue,4132999,False,"No, a disorder of subcutaneous tissue is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not specifically target the subcutaneous tissue. A disorder of subcutaneous tissue could be indicative of other conditions such as lipomas, cellulitis, or panniculitis, which are not directly related to RA. Therefore, having a disorder of subcutaneous tissue does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Phalangeal microgeodic syndrome,36674197,False,"No.

Rationale:
Phalangeal microgeodic syndrome is not a specific condition associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint erosions are a characteristic feature of RA, the term ""phalangeal microgeodic syndrome"" is not a recognized medical condition or term commonly used in the context of RA. Therefore, having phalangeal microgeodic syndrome does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of joint of left shoulder region,36713099,False,"No, osteoarthritis of the left shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While both osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect joints, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Osteoarthritis is primarily due to wear and tear on the joints, while Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left shoulder region does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Stasis dermatitis of right lower extremity due to peripheral venous hypertension,762038,False,"No, stasis dermatitis of the right lower extremity due to peripheral venous hypertension is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Stasis dermatitis is a skin condition caused by poor circulation in the legs, leading to swelling, redness, and ulcers. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can present with skin manifestations, stasis dermatitis is not a defining feature of RA. Therefore, having stasis dermatitis of the right lower extremity due to peripheral venous hypertension does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acute lymphangitis of forearm,4151426,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute lymphangitis of the forearm is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute lymphangitis is an infection of the lymphatic vessels, typically caused by bacteria entering through a break in the skin. It is characterized by red streaks on the skin, swelling, warmth, and tenderness along the affected lymphatic vessels. This condition is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop acute lymphangitis as a secondary infection, the presence of acute lymphangitis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Stasis dermatitis of left lower extremity due to peripheral venous hypertension,762037,False,"No, stasis dermatitis of the left lower extremity due to peripheral venous hypertension is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Stasis dermatitis is a skin condition caused by poor circulation in the legs, leading to swelling, redness, and ulcers. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can present with skin manifestations, stasis dermatitis is not a defining feature of RA. Additionally, the underlying cause of stasis dermatitis, peripheral venous hypertension, is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Absent finger,4323582,False,"No, an absent finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint deformities can occur in RA, an absent finger is not a common symptom of the disease. Absent fingers are more likely due to congenital abnormalities, traumatic injuries, or other conditions unrelated to RA."
Osteoarthritis of joint of right shoulder region,36713103,False,"No.

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is different from rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right shoulder region does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of left elbow due to gout,36684527,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition provided, arthritis of the left elbow due to gout, specifically mentions gout as the cause of arthritis in the left elbow. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, rather than an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis of the left elbow due to gout does not necessarily mean that the individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Demyelination of central nervous system co-occurrent and due to Sjogren disease,37110518,False,"No, demyelination of the central nervous system co-occurring and due to Sjogren disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjogren disease are autoimmune conditions, demyelination of the central nervous system is more commonly associated with conditions such as multiple sclerosis. While there may be some overlap in symptoms and manifestations between these conditions, demyelination of the central nervous system due to Sjogren disease is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of left ankle,36684526,True,"Yes, the condition of gouty arthritis of the left ankle is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gout is a separate condition from Rheumatoid Arthritis, the presence of gouty arthritis in a specific joint, such as the left ankle, does not definitively rule out the possibility of also having Rheumatoid Arthritis. In fact, it is possible for a patient to have both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, if a patient has gouty arthritis of the left ankle, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finding of ankle or foot,4305027,False,"No, the condition ""Finding of ankle or foot"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can affect the small joints of the hands and feet, finding of ankle or foot could be present in a variety of other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, or even injuries. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Podoconiosis,604362,False,"No, podoconiosis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Podoconiosis is a non-infectious disease caused by prolonged exposure to irritant minerals in soil, leading to bilateral swelling of the lower extremities. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions may present with joint swelling, they have different etiologies and treatment approaches."
Demyelination of central nervous system co-occurrent and due to systemic lupus erythematosus,37110517,False,"No, demyelination of the central nervous system co-occurring and due to systemic lupus erythematosus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While demyelination can occur in systemic lupus erythematosus, it is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Demyelination in the central nervous system is more commonly associated with conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Therefore, the presence of demyelination in systemic lupus erythematosus does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of knee,4159739,False,"No.

Rationale: Arthritis of the knee is a general term for inflammation of the knee joint, which can be caused by various conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or other forms of arthritis. While rheumatoid arthritis can affect multiple joints, including the knee, the presence of arthritis of the knee alone does not definitively indicate rheumatoid arthritis. Further evaluation, including clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings, would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in a patient with arthritis of the knee."
Calcific tendinitis of right elbow,36684523,False,"No

Rationale: Calcific tendinitis of the right elbow is a condition characterized by the deposition of calcium crystals in the tendons of the elbow, leading to pain and limited range of motion. While this condition can cause symptoms in the elbow joint, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and deformities. Therefore, having calcific tendinitis of the right elbow does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Calcific tendinitis of left elbow,36684519,False,"No

Rationale:
Calcific tendinitis of the left elbow is a condition characterized by the formation of calcium deposits within the tendons of the elbow, leading to pain and limited range of motion. While this condition can cause symptoms in the elbow joint, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and deformities. Therefore, having calcific tendinitis of the left elbow does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Osteitis of shoulder region,4049140,False,"No, osteitis of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteitis refers to inflammation of the bone, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, trauma, or other inflammatory conditions. While joint involvement is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, osteitis of the shoulder region alone is not enough to definitively diagnose RA. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings are needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chlamydial polyarthritis,4245641,False,"No, Chlamydial polyarthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chlamydial polyarthritis is a type of reactive arthritis caused by a Chlamydia infection. It typically presents with asymmetric joint involvement, particularly in the lower extremities, and is associated with genitourinary or gastrointestinal symptoms. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different etiologies and clinical presentations. Therefore, having Chlamydial polyarthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Antiphospholipid syndrome,4098292,True,"Yes, Antiphospholipid syndrome is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which can lead to blood clots in arteries and veins, as well as pregnancy complications. While Antiphospholipid syndrome is not a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it can occur in patients with RA. Therefore, if a patient has Antiphospholipid syndrome, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, having Rheumatoid Arthritis does not necessarily mean that a patient will have Antiphospholipid syndrome."
Acute lymphangitis of lower limb,604358,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute lymphangitis of the lower limb is an infection of the lymphatic vessels that typically presents with red streaks on the skin, swelling, warmth, and tenderness. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is an infection rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the synovial joints. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop acute lymphangitis as a secondary infection, having acute lymphangitis of the lower limb does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of joint of right hand,36684543,True,"Yes, the condition of monoarthritis of the joint of the right hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, meaning that it typically affects multiple joints on both sides of the body. However, monoarthritis (involvement of only one joint) can still be a manifestation of RA, especially in the early stages of the disease. Additionally, the fact that the condition specifically mentions the joint of the right hand aligns with the description of RA, which often presents with joint pain and swelling in the small joints of the hands. Therefore, if a patient has monoarthritis of the joint of the right hand, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of joint of right ankle,36684542,False,"No

Rationale: Rheumatoid Arthritis typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, particularly in the hands and feet. Monoarthritis of the right ankle would not be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it only involves one joint and is not characteristic of the typical presentation of RA. Other conditions such as gout, septic arthritis, or trauma could be more likely causes of monoarthritis in the right ankle."
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder,4208786,False,"No, the condition ""Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition is a broad category that includes a variety of disorders affecting the musculoskeletal system and connective tissues, such as arthritis, osteoporosis, and tendonitis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis falls under this category, there are many other conditions that also fall under this umbrella term. Therefore, having a musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of left knee,36684541,False,"No

Rationale: Monoarthritis of the left knee is a specific condition that refers to inflammation in only one joint, in this case, the left knee. While monoarthritis can be a symptom of various conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis typically presents as symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, not just one. Therefore, having monoarthritis of the left knee does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Monoarthritis of joint of left hand,36684540,True,"Yes, the condition of monoarthritis of the joint of the left hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, meaning that it typically affects multiple joints on both sides of the body. Monoarthritis, which refers to inflammation in a single joint, is less common in RA. However, it is still possible for RA to present initially as monoarthritis before progressing to involve multiple joints. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint involvement in the small joints of the hands, which aligns with the specific location mentioned in the condition. Therefore, if a patient presents with monoarthritis of the joint of the left hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of joint of left ankle,36684539,True,"Yes, the condition of monoarthritis of the joint of the left ankle is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, meaning that it typically affects multiple joints on both sides of the body. Monoarthritis, which refers to inflammation in a single joint, is less common in RA. However, it is still possible for RA to present as monoarthritis in some cases. Additionally, the fact that the condition specifically mentions the left ankle joint aligns with the description of RA affecting small joints like those in the hands and feet. Therefore, if a patient has monoarthritis of the left ankle, it is likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right wrist due to gout,36684535,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, ""Arthritis of right wrist due to gout,"" specifically mentions gout as the cause of arthritis in the right wrist. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a distinct autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having arthritis of the right wrist due to gout does not necessarily mean that a person has RA."
Gouty arthritis of right knee,36684534,False,"No, gouty arthritis of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gouty arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It is not typically associated with the autoimmune mechanisms seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and swelling, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the right knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Injury of nail,4167909,False,"No, injury of nail is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While some patients with RA may experience changes in their nails due to inflammation in the joints, injury of the nail can occur for a variety of reasons unrelated to RA, such as trauma or fungal infections. Therefore, the presence of an injury of the nail does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of right hand,36684533,False,"No

Rationale: Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gouty arthritis can affect the hands, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by autoimmune inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints, with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings used for diagnosis. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the right hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right elbow due to gout,36684532,False,"No, arthritis of the right elbow due to gout is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints with characteristic features such as symmetric polyarthritis, joint swelling, and deformities. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and clinical presentations. Therefore, having arthritis of the right elbow due to gout does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of lesser metatarsophalangeal joint,4067554,True,"Yes, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of lesser metatarsophalangeal joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Reactive arthropathy refers to joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, joint inflammation is a key feature of the disease, affecting multiple joints including the metatarsophalangeal joints (joints of the toes). Therefore, if a patient presents with reactive arthropathy of the lesser metatarsophalangeal joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteochondritis of metacarpal,4079842,False,"No, osteochondritis of the metacarpal is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteochondritis is a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the bone and cartilage in a joint, which can occur in various joints in the body. While joint involvement is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, osteochondritis is not a defining characteristic of RA. Additionally, osteochondritis can occur in isolation or as a result of other factors, not necessarily related to autoimmune processes as seen in RA. Therefore, having osteochondritis of the metacarpal does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of right ankle,36684531,True,"Yes, the condition of gouty arthritis of the right ankle is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gouty arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gouty arthritis is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is possible for a patient with RA to also develop gouty arthritis in a specific joint, such as the right ankle. Therefore, if a patient has gouty arthritis of the right ankle, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left wrist due to gout,36684530,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a distinct autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints. Arthritis of the left wrist due to gout is a specific condition related to gout, not Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and swelling, they have different underlying causes and treatment approaches. Therefore, having arthritis of the left wrist due to gout does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of left knee,36684529,False,"No, gouty arthritis of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gouty arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints symmetrically with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria."
Chorea co-occurrent and due to systemic lupus erythematosus,37110504,False,"No, the condition ""Chorea co-occurrent and due to systemic lupus erythematosus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chorea is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, rapid, jerky movements that may be present in various conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While SLE is listed as an exclusion for Rheumatoid Arthritis, the presence of chorea in SLE does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having chorea co-occurrent and due to SLE does not necessarily mean that a person also has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of left hand,36684528,True,"Yes, the condition of gouty arthritis of the left hand is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gouty arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gouty arthritis is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is possible for a patient with RA to also develop gouty arthritis in the left hand. Therefore, if a patient has gouty arthritis of the left hand, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of muscle of right hand,36684495,False,"No, contracture of muscle of right hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint stiffness and deformities are common symptoms of RA, contracture of a muscle in the right hand could be caused by a variety of other conditions such as Dupuytren's contracture, stroke, or trauma. It is important to consider other factors and perform a thorough evaluation to determine the underlying cause of the muscle contracture in the right hand."
Trichomycosis axillaris,4176094,False,"No, trichomycosis axillaris is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Trichomycosis axillaris is a superficial bacterial infection of the hair shafts in the axillary hair, groin, and pubic regions. It presents as yellow, red, or black concretions around the hair shafts. This condition is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder of rheumatoid arthritis."
Ingrowing fingernail (excluding thumb),4063453,False,"No

Rationale:
An ingrowing fingernail is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may experience joint pain and swelling in the small joints of the hands, an ingrowing fingernail is a separate condition that is not a defining characteristic of RA. It is important to consider other factors and symptoms when assessing for the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosis of joint of finger,4323490,True,"Yes, ankylosis of a joint of the finger is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosis refers to the abnormal stiffening and immobility of a joint due to fusion of the bones, which can occur in advanced stages of RA as a result of joint destruction and deformities. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosis of a joint of the finger, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of muscle of left hand,36684492,False,"No, contracture of muscle of the left hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint stiffness and deformities are common symptoms of RA, contractures can be caused by a variety of conditions such as trauma, neurological disorders, or prolonged immobility. Therefore, having a contracture of the muscle of the left hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Necrosis of anatomical site,43530876,False,"No, necrosis of an anatomical site is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Necrosis refers to the death of cells or tissues due to injury, infection, or lack of blood supply. While necrosis can occur in the joints of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to inflammation and damage, it is not a specific or defining feature of the disease. Necrosis can also occur in other conditions such as infections, ischemia, or trauma. Therefore, the presence of necrosis of an anatomical site does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Calcific tendinitis of right upper arm,36684488,False,"No

Rationale: Calcific tendinitis of the right upper arm is a condition characterized by the formation of calcium deposits in the tendons of the shoulder. While this condition can cause pain and limited range of motion in the affected shoulder, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having calcific tendinitis of the right upper arm does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Calcific tendinitis of left upper arm,36684487,False,"No

Rationale: Calcific tendinitis of the left upper arm is a condition characterized by the formation of calcium deposits in the tendons of the shoulder. While this condition can cause pain and limited range of motion in the affected arm, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having calcific tendinitis of the left upper arm does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic kidney disease,46271022,False,"No, chronic kidney disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While chronic kidney disease can occur as a complication of RA due to long-term inflammation and medication use, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Chronic kidney disease can have various causes and can occur independently of RA. Therefore, having chronic kidney disease does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of right lower extremity,764155,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of right lower extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple joints throughout the body, not just the right lower extremity. The condition described is too general and could be indicative of a wide range of musculoskeletal issues, not necessarily RA. Additional information such as joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to definitively link this condition to RA."
Disorder of left upper extremity,764154,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of left upper extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, it can involve multiple joints throughout the body, not just the left upper extremity. Additionally, a disorder of the left upper extremity could be caused by a variety of other conditions such as trauma, nerve compression, or other types of arthritis. Therefore, having a disorder of the left upper extremity does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of right upper extremity,764153,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of right upper extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple joints throughout the body, not just the right upper extremity. Additionally, the description of RA does not specifically mention the right upper extremity as a common site of involvement. Therefore, having a disorder of the right upper extremity does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of subtalar joint,4065484,False,"No, reactive arthropathy of the subtalar joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy refers to joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition. In this case, it is specifically affecting the subtalar joint. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly the small joints of the hands and feet, and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While joint inflammation is a common feature of both conditions, the specific location and underlying causes are different. Therefore, having reactive arthropathy of the subtalar joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Neuropathic spondylopathy,4067532,False,"No, neuropathic spondylopathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Neuropathic spondylopathy refers to a condition affecting the spine characterized by nerve damage or dysfunction, which can be caused by various factors such as trauma, infection, or metabolic disorders. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop neuropathic symptoms due to nerve compression or inflammation in the spine, neuropathic spondylopathy is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having neuropathic spondylopathy does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of right hand,36684509,False,"No.

Rationale:
A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the right hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance that has been implanted in the body. It is not a characteristic symptom or diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop a foreign body granuloma as a result of treatment or other factors, the presence of a foreign body granuloma does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of talonavicular joint,4065485,False,"No, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of talonavicular joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy refers to joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition. In this case, it specifically involves the talonavicular joint. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings for diagnosis. While joint inflammation can be a feature of both conditions, the specific nature of the joint involvement and underlying mechanisms differ between reactive arthropathy and Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic arthritis of juvenile onset,4257971,True,"Yes, chronic arthritis of juvenile onset can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: Chronic arthritis of juvenile onset, also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), is a group of chronic inflammatory joint conditions that begin before the age of 16 and persist for at least 6 weeks. One subtype of JIA, called rheumatoid factor-positive polyarticular JIA, shares similarities with adult-onset Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in terms of joint involvement, symmetrical polyarthritis, and systemic inflammation. Therefore, if a patient has chronic arthritis of juvenile onset, specifically the rheumatoid factor-positive polyarticular subtype, they may be diagnosed with RA. However, not all cases of chronic arthritis of juvenile onset are specific to RA, as there are other subtypes of JIA and other forms of arthritis that can present in childhood."
Arthritis of hip,4286642,False,"No

Rationale: Arthritis of the hip is a specific condition affecting the hip joint, while Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. While it is possible for Rheumatoid Arthritis to affect the hip joint, the presence of arthritis in the hip alone does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in a patient with arthritis of the hip."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of left hand,36684508,False,"No

Rationale: A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the left hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance, such as a splinter or implant material, and is not a characteristic feature of RA. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with foreign body granulomas in the soft tissues of the hand. Therefore, having a foreign body granuloma of the soft tissue of the left hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, undifferentiated arthritis",4257972,True,"Yes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, undifferentiated arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and undifferentiated arthritis are conditions that fall under the umbrella of arthritis, which is a broad term encompassing various inflammatory conditions affecting the joints. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a specific type of arthritis characterized by autoimmune inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints. JIA and undifferentiated arthritis do not specifically meet the criteria for RA, which includes symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, as well as specific serological markers and imaging findings. Therefore, having JIA or undifferentiated arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has RA, but having RA may present with symptoms similar to those seen in JIA or undifferentiated arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of metacarpophalangeal joint,4065480,True,"Yes, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of metacarpophalangeal joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including the metacarpophalangeal joints. Reactive arthropathy refers to joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, inflammation in the metacarpophalangeal joints is a characteristic feature of the disease. Therefore, if a patient has reactive arthropathy of the metacarpophalangeal joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of specific body structures or tissue,4180169,False,"No, the condition ""Inflammation of specific body structures or tissue"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While inflammation is a key feature of RA, it is a nonspecific symptom that can be present in a variety of other conditions as well. Inflammation can occur in response to infection, injury, or other autoimmune diseases, so it is not exclusive to RA. To definitively diagnose RA, additional criteria such as joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings need to be considered."
Disorder of left lower extremity,764156,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of left lower extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple joints throughout the body, not just the left lower extremity. Additionally, the description of RA does not specifically mention a disorder of the left lower extremity as a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having a disorder of the left lower extremity does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Psoriasis palmaris,4063433,True,"Yes, Psoriasis palmaris is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Psoriasis palmaris is a specific type of psoriasis that affects the palms of the hands. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin condition that involves the rapid growth of skin cells, leading to the formation of thick, silvery scales and itchy, dry, red patches. Psoriasis is known to be associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, as both are autoimmune conditions. In fact, individuals with psoriasis have an increased risk of developing Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a person has Psoriasis palmaris, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of distal interphalangeal joint of finger,4065481,False,"No, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of distal interphalangeal joint of finger"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Reactive arthropathy is a term used to describe joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In this case, the involvement of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger suggests a localized inflammatory response rather than the systemic autoimmune process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

While joint involvement is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific location and nature of the joint inflammation described in the condition provided do not align with the typical presentation of RA. Therefore, having reactive arthropathy of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Immunoglobulin G4 related disease,36717255,False,"No, Immunoglobulin G4 related disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Immunoglobulin G4 related disease is a chronic immune-mediated condition characterized by tissue infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells, fibrosis, and tumefactive lesions in various organs. While both conditions involve autoimmune processes, they affect different organs and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having Immunoglobulin G4 related disease does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Injury of blood vessel,192763,False,"No, injury of a blood vessel is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While inflammation is a key feature of RA, injury of a blood vessel is a general condition that can occur in various medical situations, not just in the context of RA. In RA, the primary focus is on joint inflammation and destruction, rather than specifically on blood vessel injury."
Reactive arthropathy of wrist,4065479,False,"No.

Rationale:
Reactive arthropathy of the wrist is a condition characterized by inflammation and swelling of the joints in response to an infection or other trigger. While it may present with similar symptoms to rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Reactive arthropathy of the wrist can be caused by various factors such as infections, trauma, or other inflammatory conditions. Therefore, having reactive arthropathy of the wrist does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Effusion of joint of left knee,36684501,True,"Yes, effusion of the joint of the left knee can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Effusion, or swelling, of the joint is a common symptom of RA due to the inflammation and synovitis that occurs in the disease. In RA, the synovial lining of the joint becomes inflamed and produces excess fluid, leading to joint swelling and effusion. Therefore, if a patient presents with effusion of the joint of the left knee, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis, although further evaluation and diagnostic criteria would need to be met for a definitive diagnosis."
Inflammation of peripheral nerve of right upper limb,762102,False,"No

Rationale: Inflammation of a peripheral nerve in the right upper limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is characterized by joint inflammation and destruction, inflammation of a peripheral nerve in the upper limb could be indicative of other conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, brachial plexopathy, or other nerve-related disorders. It is important to consider other factors and symptoms in addition to this condition to make a proper diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of peripheral nerve of left upper limb,762101,False,"No, inflammation of a peripheral nerve of the left upper limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is characterized by joint inflammation and destruction, inflammation of a peripheral nerve in the upper limb is not a typical symptom of RA. This condition could be indicative of other issues such as nerve entrapment, trauma, infection, or other inflammatory conditions. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to determine the underlying cause of the nerve inflammation in the left upper limb."
Mortons neuroma of right foot,762127,False,"No, Morton's neuroma of the right foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Morton's neuroma is a benign growth of nerve tissue that typically occurs between the third and fourth toes, causing pain, numbness, and tingling in the affected area. It is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have Morton's neuroma, the presence of Morton's neuroma does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Onchocercal subcutaneous nodule,4346183,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Onchocercal subcutaneous nodules, on the other hand, are a manifestation of onchocerciasis, a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus. These nodules are firm, painless, subcutaneous swellings that contain adult worms. While both conditions can present with nodules, they are caused by different underlying pathologies and are not directly related. Therefore, the presence of an onchocercal subcutaneous nodule does not necessarily indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acute lymphangitis of wrist,4102457,False,"No

Rationale: Acute lymphangitis of the wrist is an infection of the lymphatic vessels, typically caused by bacteria entering through a break in the skin. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is an acute infection rather than a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the synovial joints. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop acute lymphangitis of the wrist, having acute lymphangitis of the wrist does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finding of subtalar joint,4104503,False,"No, the condition ""Finding of subtalar joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. The finding of subtalar joint refers to an observation or imaging result related to the subtalar joint, which is a joint in the foot. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the hands and feet, the presence of a finding in the subtalar joint alone does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis would be needed for a diagnosis."
Spade-like hand,4167986,True,"Yes, a spade-like hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint deformities can occur due to chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints. One characteristic deformity seen in RA is the development of a spade-like hand, where the fingers become deviated towards the little finger side of the hand, resulting in a characteristic appearance resembling a spade. This deformity is a classic feature of advanced RA and is not typically seen in other forms of arthritis. Therefore, if a patient presents with a spade-like hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteitis of ankle AND/OR foot,4262220,False,"No, osteitis of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteitis refers to inflammation of the bone, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, trauma, or other inflammatory conditions. While joint involvement is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, osteitis alone does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Further evaluation, including clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings, would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in a patient presenting with osteitis of the ankle and/or foot."
Partial failure replanted thumb,4309324,False,"No

Rationale: A partial failure of a replanted thumb is a specific condition related to a traumatic injury to the thumb, typically involving the loss of blood supply and subsequent reattachment of the thumb. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While a person with RA may have experienced a traumatic injury resulting in a partial failure of a replanted thumb, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Bacterial arthritis,4167984,False,"No

Rationale: Bacterial arthritis is a separate condition from Rheumatoid Arthritis. Bacterial arthritis is caused by an infection in a joint, leading to inflammation and symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and fever. It is typically diagnosed based on joint fluid analysis and treated with antibiotics. While both conditions can present with joint pain and swelling, they have different underlying causes and require different treatment approaches. Therefore, having bacterial arthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of peripheral nerve of left lower limb,762139,False,"No, inflammation of a peripheral nerve of the left lower limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is characterized by joint inflammation and destruction, inflammation of a peripheral nerve in the lower limb is not a typical symptom of RA. This condition may be more indicative of other conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, sciatica, or other nerve-related disorders. It is important to consider other factors and symptoms when diagnosing a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of peripheral nerve of right lower limb,762138,False,"No, inflammation of a peripheral nerve of the right lower limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is characterized by joint inflammation and destruction, inflammation of a peripheral nerve in the lower limb is not a typical symptom of RA. This condition may be more indicative of other issues such as peripheral neuropathy, sciatica, or other nerve-related disorders. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to determine the underlying cause of the nerve inflammation in the right lower limb."
Inflammation of peripheral nerve of left ankle,762137,False,"No

Rationale: Inflammation of a peripheral nerve of the left ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is characterized by joint inflammation, the presence of inflammation in a peripheral nerve of the left ankle does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. This condition could be related to other factors such as trauma, compression, or other medical conditions. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing would be needed to determine the underlying cause of the nerve inflammation."
Inflammation of peripheral nerve of right ankle,762136,False,"No.

Rationale: Inflammation of a peripheral nerve of the right ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is characterized by joint inflammation, the presence of inflammation in a peripheral nerve of the right ankle does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. This condition could be related to other factors such as trauma, compression, or other medical conditions. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing would be needed to determine the underlying cause of the nerve inflammation."
Acquired varus deformity of right knee,36684604,False,"No, acquired varus deformity of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Varus deformity of the knee refers to a condition where the knee joint is angled inward, leading to a bow-legged appearance. While joint deformities can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint destruction, varus deformity of the knee is not a specific or defining feature of RA. It can be caused by various other conditions such as osteoarthritis, trauma, or congenital abnormalities. Therefore, the presence of acquired varus deformity of the right knee does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Complete tear of sternoclavicular ligament,4014379,False,"No, a complete tear of the sternoclavicular ligament is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A complete tear of the sternoclavicular ligament is a specific injury to the ligament that connects the sternum to the clavicle, typically caused by trauma or overuse. It is not a characteristic symptom or feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder."
Acquired varus deformity of left knee,36684601,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While joint deformities can occur in RA, an acquired varus deformity of the left knee is not specific to RA. Varus deformity of the knee is typically associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis, trauma, or congenital abnormalities. Therefore, the presence of an acquired varus deformity of the left knee does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Lupus erythematosus-associated necrotizing vasculitis,4301142,False,"No

Rationale:
Lupus erythematosus-associated necrotizing vasculitis is a specific condition associated with lupus erythematosus, not rheumatoid arthritis. While both conditions are autoimmune diseases, they are distinct entities with different pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having lupus erythematosus-associated necrotizing vasculitis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Mortons neuroma of left foot,762128,False,"No, Morton's neuroma of the left foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Morton's neuroma is a benign growth of nerve tissue that typically occurs between the third and fourth toes, causing pain, numbness, and tingling in the toes and ball of the foot. It is not a symptom or characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may experience foot pain, it is not typically attributed to Morton's neuroma."
Primary necrotizing systemic vasculitis,4344167,True,"Yes, primary necrotizing systemic vasculitis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Primary necrotizing systemic vasculitis is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and necrosis of blood vessel walls, leading to organ damage and dysfunction. Rheumatoid Arthritis is known to be associated with vasculitis, including primary necrotizing systemic vasculitis. In some cases, vasculitis can be a complication of RA, affecting small and medium-sized blood vessels. Therefore, if a patient with RA develops primary necrotizing systemic vasculitis, it is highly likely that the two conditions are related."
Atrophy of muscle of right hand,36684550,False,"No, atrophy of the muscle of the right hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Atrophy of muscle can be caused by a variety of factors such as nerve damage, disuse, or other medical conditions. While atrophy of muscle can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint inflammation and damage affecting muscle function, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having atrophy of the muscle of the right hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Arthropathy associated with mycoses, of the shoulder region",80175,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition ""Arthropathy associated with mycoses, of the shoulder region"" specifically refers to joint pathology associated with fungal infections in the shoulder region. While joint involvement can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specifically associated with fungal infections. Therefore, having arthropathy associated with mycoses in the shoulder region does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Atrophy of muscle of left hand,36684545,False,"No, atrophy of the muscle of the left hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Muscle atrophy can be caused by a variety of factors such as disuse, nerve damage, or other medical conditions. While muscle atrophy can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint inflammation and limited mobility, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having atrophy of the muscle of the left hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of right knee,36684544,False,"No, monoarthritis of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Monoarthritis refers to inflammation in a single joint, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints. Additionally, the specific location of the right knee does not align with the characteristic joint involvement seen in RA, which often affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, monoarthritis of the right knee is not a specific indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of shoulder,46273523,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. It is an autoimmune disease characterized by morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. 

On the other hand, primary chronic gout without tophus of the shoulder is a condition characterized by recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis due to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and other tissues. Gout typically affects the big toe joint but can also involve other joints such as the shoulder.

While both conditions involve joint pain and inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of the shoulder does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis,80180,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and functional impairment. While both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are forms of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and pathophysiology. Osteoarthritis is primarily a mechanical wear-and-tear process, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Therefore, having osteoarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
"Localized, secondary osteoarthritis of the ankle and/or foot",80183,False,"No

Rationale: Localized, secondary osteoarthritis of the ankle and/or foot is a specific condition that refers to osteoarthritis affecting the ankle and/or foot joints as a result of a specific cause, such as trauma or abnormal joint mechanics. While osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a distinct autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having localized, secondary osteoarthritis of the ankle and/or foot does not necessarily mean that an individual has rheumatoid arthritis."
Acquired deformity of right finger,762173,False,"No

Rationale: An acquired deformity of the right finger is a specific physical finding that can be seen in various conditions, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can lead to joint deformities in the fingers, there are other conditions such as osteoarthritis, trauma, or congenital abnormalities that can also cause finger deformities. Therefore, the presence of an acquired deformity of the right finger does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Subacute infective polyarthritis,4243832,False,"No, subacute infective polyarthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Subacute infective polyarthritis refers to a type of arthritis caused by an infectious agent, such as bacteria or viruses, leading to joint inflammation. While Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, subacute infective polyarthritis is caused by an infection. Therefore, having subacute infective polyarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition ""Derangement of medial meniscus of right knee"" refers to a specific injury or issue with the meniscus in the knee joint, which is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling, the specific issue with the medial meniscus is not a defining feature of the disease."
Spondylosis,4227449,False,"No

Rationale:
Spondylosis is a degenerative condition of the spine, primarily affecting the intervertebral discs and vertebral bodies. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as spondylosis is a separate condition that can occur independently of RA. While patients with RA may develop spondylosis as a secondary condition due to chronic inflammation and joint damage, having spondylosis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Derangement of medial meniscus of left knee,762161,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Derangement of medial meniscus of left knee"" is specific to a problem with the meniscus in the knee joint, which is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not specifically target the meniscus in the knee. Therefore, having a derangement of the medial meniscus of the left knee does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Autoimmune retinopathy,37110540,False,"No, autoimmune retinopathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Autoimmune retinopathy is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the retina of the eye, leading to progressive vision loss. While autoimmune diseases can coexist, having autoimmune retinopathy does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Each condition affects different parts of the body and has distinct diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches."
Recurrent dislocation of shoulder region,80186,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While joint involvement is a common symptom of RA, recurrent dislocation of the shoulder region is not a specific symptom of RA. Recurrent dislocation of the shoulder region may be caused by other factors such as ligament laxity or trauma. Therefore, having recurrent dislocation of the shoulder region does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of ankle and/or foot,40481620,False,"No

Rationale:
Infective arthritis of the ankle and/or foot is a specific condition related to a bacterial or fungal infection in the joint, leading to inflammation and symptoms such as pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. While infective arthritis can present with similar symptoms to rheumatoid arthritis, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Navicular disease,4282750,False,"No, navicular disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Navicular disease is a condition that affects the navicular bone in the foot of horses, causing lameness and pain. It is not related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that is Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints in humans."
Inflammation of rotator cuff tendon,40483628,False,"No, inflammation of the rotator cuff tendon is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Inflammation of the rotator cuff tendon is a common condition that can occur due to overuse, injury, or age-related degeneration. While inflammation can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it can also occur in other conditions such as tendonitis or bursitis. Therefore, having inflammation of the rotator cuff tendon does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of right foot,37108592,False,"No, gouty arthritis of the right foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and RA are forms of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder. Additionally, RA primarily affects the synovial joints, while gout commonly affects the big toe joint. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the right foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of right great toe,37108593,True,"Yes, the condition of gouty arthritis of the right great toe is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gouty arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gout and RA are both forms of arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and clinical presentations. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the right great toe does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic manifestations,37204863,True,"Yes, the condition ""Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic manifestations"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic manifestations (RVCL-S) is a rare systemic microvascular disorder that has been associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. RVCL-S is characterized by retinopathy, leukoencephalopathy, and systemic manifestations such as arthritis, skin changes, and neuropathy. While not all patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis will develop RVCL-S, if a patient has RVCL-S, they are likely to have Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, the condition is specific to the malady."
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of left hand,762178,True,"Yes, the condition ""Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of left hand"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a type of arthritis that affects children, and it can present with symptoms similar to those seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis, such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Since the condition specifically mentions arthritis of the left hand, and Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the small joints of the hands, it is likely that a patient with this condition would also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, the autoimmune nature of both conditions further supports the specificity of the condition to the malady."
Palmar varices,4032884,False,"No, palmar varices are not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Palmar varices refer to dilated veins in the palm of the hand, which can be caused by various factors such as liver disease, heart failure, or chronic venous insufficiency. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can cause joint swelling and deformities in the hands, palmar varices are not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having palmar varices does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tenosynovitis of hand,4311304,False,"No

Rationale:
Tenosynovitis of the hand is a condition characterized by inflammation of the synovial sheath surrounding a tendon in the hand. While tenosynovitis can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) due to the inflammatory nature of the disease affecting the synovial joints, it is not specific to RA. Tenosynovitis can also be seen in other conditions such as overuse injuries, infections, and inflammatory conditions like gout. Therefore, having tenosynovitis of the hand does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Osteochondritis of carpal lunate,4280587,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteochondritis of the carpal lunate is a condition that affects the carpal bones in the wrist, specifically the lunate bone. While it can cause wrist pain and stiffness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having osteochondritis of the carpal lunate does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of right sternoclavicular joint,37108604,True,"Yes, arthritis of the right sternoclavicular joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple joints in the body, including the sternoclavicular joint. The presence of arthritis in this specific joint, especially in combination with other symptoms such as morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling in other joints, can be indicative of RA. Additionally, RA is known to cause joint destruction and deformities, which can also be seen in the sternoclavicular joint in patients with RA. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis of the right sternoclavicular joint, it is possible that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left glenohumeral joint,37108602,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of left glenohumeral joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, including the glenohumeral joint. The presence of arthritis in the left glenohumeral joint would be consistent with the joint involvement seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, the symmetric polyarthritis characteristic of RA can involve multiple joints, including the glenohumeral joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the left glenohumeral joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of right hand,762180,True,"Yes, the condition ""Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of right hand"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a type of arthritis that affects children under the age of 16 and can involve one or more joints. In this case, the condition specifically mentions arthritis in the right hand, which aligns with the description of RA affecting small joints, including those in the hands. Additionally, the term ""idiopathic"" suggests that the cause of the arthritis is unknown, which is consistent with the autoimmune nature of RA. Therefore, if a patient has been diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis of the right hand, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of right foot due to trauma,37108601,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the articular cartilage, leading to joint pain and stiffness. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, the underlying mechanisms and treatment approaches are different. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right foot due to trauma does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right shoulder caused by bacteria,37108583,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings. The condition of ""Arthritis of right shoulder caused by bacteria"" suggests an infection-related arthritis, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While infections can trigger autoimmune responses in some cases, the presence of bacteria causing arthritis in the right shoulder does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional diagnostic criteria specific to RA would need to be considered for a definitive diagnosis."
Adhesive capsulitis of left shoulder,762207,False,"No, adhesive capsulitis of the left shoulder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint, limiting range of motion. It is caused by inflammation and tightening of the capsule surrounding the shoulder joint. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect multiple joints, including the shoulder, adhesive capsulitis is not a defining feature of RA. Therefore, having adhesive capsulitis of the left shoulder does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Flexor tenosynovitis of finger,4002153,True,"Yes, flexor tenosynovitis of the finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In patients with RA, inflammation can affect the synovial sheath surrounding the flexor tendons in the fingers, leading to flexor tenosynovitis. This condition is commonly seen in RA patients due to the systemic autoimmune inflammation characteristic of the disease. Therefore, if a patient presents with flexor tenosynovitis of the finger, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rheumatic heart disease,319825,False,"No.

Rheumatic heart disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatic heart disease is a condition that develops as a complication of untreated or inadequately treated streptococcal throat infections, leading to damage and scarring of the heart valves. While both conditions involve inflammation and can affect the joints, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having rheumatic heart disease does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Adhesive capsulitis of right shoulder,762206,False,"No, adhesive capsulitis of the right shoulder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, is a condition characterized by pain and stiffness in the shoulder joint. It is caused by inflammation and thickening of the capsule surrounding the shoulder joint, leading to decreased range of motion. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect multiple joints, including the shoulder, adhesive capsulitis is not a defining feature of RA. Therefore, having adhesive capsulitis of the right shoulder does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic crepitant synovitis of hand and wrist,4002155,True,"Yes, chronic crepitant synovitis of hand and wrist is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: Chronic crepitant synovitis refers to the presence of joint crepitus (a crackling or popping sound) along with inflammation of the synovial membrane in the hand and wrist joints. This is a common manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as the disease primarily affects the synovial joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient presents with chronic crepitant synovitis of the hand and wrist, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of flexor carpi ulnaris,40481598,False,"No. Tendinitis of flexor carpi ulnaris is a condition involving inflammation of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle in the wrist. While this condition may cause wrist pain and swelling, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with characteristic joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings. Tendinitis of flexor carpi ulnaris is a localized condition affecting a specific tendon in the wrist and is not a defining feature of RA."
Biceps femoris tendinitis,4002148,False,"No, biceps femoris tendinitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Biceps femoris tendinitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the biceps femoris tendon, which is one of the hamstring muscles located in the back of the thigh. It is typically caused by overuse, injury, or repetitive strain. While joint pain and inflammation are common symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis, biceps femoris tendinitis is a localized condition affecting a specific tendon and is not a defining feature of RA. Therefore, having biceps femoris tendinitis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left knee caused by bacteria,37108588,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left knee caused by bacteria"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis caused by bacteria in the left knee suggests an infectious etiology rather than an autoimmune one. In this case, the condition is more likely related to a bacterial infection such as septic arthritis rather than Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy,45765600,False,"No.

Rationale:
Retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy is a rare genetic disorder that affects the blood vessels in the eyes, ears, and brain. There is no known association between retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy and rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Infective arthritis of left knee,37108589,False,"No, infective arthritis of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is a condition caused by an infection in the joint. It is characterized by joint pain, swelling, redness, and limited range of motion. The infection can be bacterial, viral, or fungal in nature. 

While both infective arthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis can present with joint pain and swelling, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease, while infective arthritis is caused by an infection. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the left knee does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left hip caused by bacteria,37108586,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left hip caused by bacteria"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis caused by bacteria in the left hip suggests an infectious etiology rather than an autoimmune one. In Rheumatoid Arthritis, the joint involvement is typically symmetric and involves multiple joints, whereas bacterial arthritis usually affects a single joint. Additionally, the treatment and management of bacterial arthritis would differ from that of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Abscess of tendon sheath of left ankle and/or foot,762198,False,"No

Rationale: An abscess of the tendon sheath of the left ankle and/or foot is a localized infection that does not specifically correlate with the systemic autoimmune inflammatory disorder of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a patient with RA may potentially develop an abscess due to their compromised immune system, the presence of an abscess of the tendon sheath does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Subacromial impingement,4002144,False,"No, subacromial impingement is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Subacromial impingement is a condition where the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles become irritated and inflamed as they pass through the subacromial space, causing pain and limited range of motion in the shoulder. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience shoulder pain, subacromial impingement is not a defining characteristic of RA. Subacromial impingement can occur in individuals with various underlying conditions or even as a result of overuse or injury."
Arthritis of right knee caused by bacteria,37108587,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is not specifically caused by bacteria. It is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues, primarily affecting the synovial joints. While bacterial infections can sometimes lead to arthritis in a joint, this specific condition does not align with the description of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of extremity,133468,False,"No, a disorder of extremity is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, a disorder of extremity is a very general term that could encompass a wide range of conditions affecting the arms or legs, such as fractures, sprains, strains, or other types of arthritis like osteoarthritis. Therefore, having a disorder of extremity does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left shoulder caused by bacteria,37108584,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left shoulder caused by bacteria"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is an autoimmune disease and not caused by bacteria. The presence of bacteria causing arthritis in the left shoulder would suggest a different type of arthritis, such as septic arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis of the left shoulder caused by bacteria does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of metatarsophalangeal joint of second toe,40481591,False,"No

Rationale: Tendinitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the second toe is a specific condition affecting the tendons in the foot, typically causing pain and inflammation in that area. While it is possible for someone with Rheumatoid Arthritis to also have tendinitis in the foot, the presence of tendinitis in the metatarsophalangeal joint of the second toe does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and presents with specific symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness, which are not necessarily associated with tendinitis in the foot."
Arthritis of right hip caused by bacteria,37108585,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings. The condition of ""Arthritis of right hip caused by bacteria"" suggests an infectious etiology rather than an autoimmune one, and it does not specifically align with the characteristics of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While infectious arthritis can present with joint pain and swelling, the underlying cause and diagnostic criteria are different from those of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis of the right hip caused by bacteria does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic tophaceous gout of right wrist due to renal impairment,762219,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic tophaceous gout is a condition characterized by the deposition of urate crystals in the joints and soft tissues, leading to the formation of tophi. While gout is a form of arthritis, it is distinct from rheumatoid arthritis in terms of its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment. Gout is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, leading to the formation of urate crystals, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints. Additionally, the presence of renal impairment in this condition suggests a different underlying cause compared to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, chronic tophaceous gout of the right wrist due to renal impairment is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Draining sinus co-occurrent and due to chronic osteomyelitis of left shoulder,762222,True,"Yes, the condition of draining sinus co-occurrent and due to chronic osteomyelitis of the left shoulder is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale:
In Rheumatoid Arthritis, chronic inflammation can lead to the development of extra-articular manifestations, including subcutaneous nodules and cutaneous vasculitis. Draining sinus tracts can also occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, particularly in the setting of chronic osteomyelitis. Therefore, the presence of a draining sinus co-occurrent and due to chronic osteomyelitis of the left shoulder would be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis as a potential underlying cause."
Osteoarthritis of foot joint,4202790,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the foot joint does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Derangement of shoulder,45757404,False,"No, a derangement of the shoulder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a key feature of RA, it primarily affects the synovial joints in the hands and feet. A derangement of the shoulder could be indicative of a variety of other conditions such as rotator cuff injuries, adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), or osteoarthritis. Therefore, having a derangement of the shoulder does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Aseptic necrosis of head of humerus,141673,False,"No, aseptic necrosis of the head of the humerus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Aseptic necrosis, also known as avascular necrosis, is a condition where there is a loss of blood supply to a bone, leading to bone death. It can occur in various bones in the body, including the head of the humerus. While aseptic necrosis can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having aseptic necrosis of the head of the humerus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of shoulder due to neurological disorder,46273449,False,"No, arthropathy of the shoulder due to a neurological disorder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Arthropathy refers to any disease or abnormal condition affecting a joint, and in this case, it is specifically related to a neurological disorder affecting the shoulder joint. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While RA can affect multiple joints, including the shoulder, the presence of arthropathy in the shoulder due to a neurological disorder does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. It is important to consider the specific symptoms, signs, and diagnostic criteria for RA when assessing for this condition."
Autosomal systemic lupus erythematosus,36676444,False,"No, autosomal systemic lupus erythematosus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a separate autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the joints. While both SLE and RA are autoimmune diseases that can involve joint symptoms, they are distinct conditions with different diagnostic criteria, serological markers, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having autosomal systemic lupus erythematosus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic osteomyelitis of carpal bone,37018432,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic osteomyelitis of carpal bone is a condition involving chronic infection and inflammation of the bone, typically caused by bacteria. While chronic osteomyelitis can cause joint pain and swelling, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, with characteristic features such as symmetric polyarthritis, morning stiffness, and joint deformities. Therefore, having chronic osteomyelitis of carpal bone does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Lung disease with Sjögren's disease,4055370,False,"No, lung disease with Sjögren's disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While lung involvement can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Lung disease with Sjögren's disease is more commonly associated with Sjögren's syndrome, another autoimmune disorder that can coexist with Rheumatoid Arthritis but is not specific to it. Therefore, having lung disease with Sjögren's disease does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Draining sinus co-occurrent and due to chronic osteomyelitis of right shoulder,762227,True,"Yes, the condition of draining sinus co-occurrent and due to chronic osteomyelitis of the right shoulder is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily a joint disorder affecting the synovial joints, and it does not typically present with draining sinuses due to chronic osteomyelitis. This condition is more indicative of a chronic bone infection rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA. Therefore, if a patient has a draining sinus co-occurrent and due to chronic osteomyelitis of the right shoulder, it is unlikely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteitis of hand,4065727,False,"No, osteitis of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteitis refers to inflammation of the bone, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, trauma, or other inflammatory conditions. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can lead to joint inflammation and damage in the hands, osteitis of the hand is a more general term that can be seen in a variety of conditions beyond RA. Therefore, having osteitis of the hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Soft tissue lesion of elbow region,4344259,False,"No, a soft tissue lesion of the elbow region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint swelling and tenderness are common symptoms of RA, a soft tissue lesion in the elbow region could be caused by a variety of other conditions such as bursitis, tendonitis, or even a soft tissue tumor. Therefore, the presence of a soft tissue lesion in the elbow region does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Avascular necrosis of the head of humerus,4067772,False,"No

Rationale: Avascular necrosis of the head of the humerus is a condition characterized by the death of bone tissue due to a lack of blood supply. While avascular necrosis can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as a result of joint inflammation and damage, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Avascular necrosis can also occur in other conditions or as a result of trauma or certain medications. Therefore, having avascular necrosis of the head of the humerus does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Contracture of joint of right shoulder region,762248,False,"No, contracture of the joint of the right shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Contracture of a joint refers to a condition where there is a loss of motion in a joint due to structural changes in the joint tissues. While joint contractures can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to chronic inflammation and joint damage, they can also be caused by other conditions such as trauma, prolonged immobilization, or neurological disorders. Therefore, the presence of a joint contracture in the right shoulder region does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Myocarditis due to autoimmune disease,3656114,True,"Yes, myocarditis due to autoimmune disease can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease, meaning it can affect various organs and tissues in the body, including the heart. Myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle, can occur as a complication of Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the autoimmune response affecting the heart. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops myocarditis due to autoimmune disease, it is likely specific to their underlying condition of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Effusion of right knee joint,762253,True,"Yes, effusion of the right knee joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Effusion, or swelling, of the joints is a common symptom of RA due to the inflammation and synovial fluid accumulation in the affected joints. In RA, the synovial lining of the joints becomes inflamed, leading to increased production of synovial fluid and subsequent joint swelling. Therefore, if a patient presents with effusion of the right knee joint, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis, especially when considered in conjunction with other symptoms such as morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling in multiple joints. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of joint effusion and to confirm the diagnosis through clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings as mentioned in the description of RA."
Aseptic necrosis of right medial femoral condyle,37108670,True,"Yes, aseptic necrosis of the right medial femoral condyle is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Aseptic necrosis, also known as avascular necrosis, is a condition where there is a loss of blood supply to a bone, leading to bone death. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic inflammation and destruction of joints can lead to aseptic necrosis in various joints, including the femoral condyles. Therefore, if a patient has aseptic necrosis of the right medial femoral condyle, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of the shoulder region associated with helminthiasis,74120,False,"No, arthropathy of the shoulder region associated with helminthiasis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Arthropathy refers to any disease or abnormal condition affecting the joints, and in this case, it is associated with helminthiasis, which is an infection by parasitic worms. The presence of arthropathy in the shoulder region in this context is more likely related to the helminthiasis infection rather than Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings. The condition mentioned does not align with the typical presentation of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of joint of left shoulder region,762242,False,"No, contracture of the joint of the left shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Contracture of a joint refers to a condition where there is a loss of motion in a joint due to structural changes in the joint tissues. While joint contractures can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to chronic inflammation and joint damage, they can also be caused by other conditions such as trauma, prolonged immobilization, neurological disorders, or other types of arthritis. Therefore, having a contracture of the joint of the left shoulder region does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Polyneuropathy,4174262,False,"No, polyneuropathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Polyneuropathy is a condition that involves damage to multiple peripheral nerves, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain in the extremities. While polyneuropathy can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis as a result of inflammation or medication side effects, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having polyneuropathy does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Aseptic necrosis of left medial femoral condyle,37108671,True,"Yes, aseptic necrosis of the left medial femoral condyle can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Aseptic necrosis, also known as avascular necrosis, is a condition where there is a loss of blood supply to a bone, leading to bone death. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic inflammation and autoimmune response can lead to damage to blood vessels supplying the bone, resulting in aseptic necrosis. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops aseptic necrosis of the left medial femoral condyle, it is likely a manifestation of their underlying RA."
Triggering of digit,4344264,False,"No, triggering of digit is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Trigger finger, also known as stenosing tenosynovitis, is a condition where one of your fingers gets stuck in a bent position and then straightens with a snap. It is caused by inflammation or thickening of the tendon sheath in the affected finger. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect the joints in the hands and fingers, triggering of digit is not a defining symptom of RA. Therefore, having triggering of digit does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of elbow,40483813,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Infective arthritis of the elbow, on the other hand, is a specific condition involving a bacterial or fungal infection of the elbow joint, leading to symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, redness, and limited range of motion. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the elbow does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Allergic arthritis of the ankle and/or foot,74129,False,"No

Rationale: Allergic arthritis of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Allergic arthritis is typically a reaction to an allergen, leading to inflammation in the joints. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. The symptoms and diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis are different from those of allergic arthritis. Therefore, having allergic arthritis of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Lateral epicondylitis of left humerus,762267,False,"No.

Rationale:
Lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, is a condition characterized by pain and inflammation of the tendons on the outer side of the elbow. While it can cause joint pain and discomfort, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having lateral epicondylitis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic drug-induced interstitial lung disorders,4112814,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic drug-induced interstitial lung disorders are not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While some medications used to treat RA, such as methotrexate, can potentially cause interstitial lung disease as a side effect, the presence of chronic drug-induced interstitial lung disorders does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Other conditions or factors could also lead to interstitial lung disease, so it is not specific to RA."
Arthritis,4291025,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Arthritis is a general term that refers to inflammation of the joints, and there are many different types of arthritis, including Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis specifically. Additional diagnostic criteria, such as joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings, are needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Impingement syndrome of right shoulder region,762264,False,"No

Rationale: Impingement syndrome of the right shoulder region is a condition that involves compression of the structures in the shoulder joint, leading to pain and limited range of motion. While this condition can cause symptoms in the shoulder joint, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and deformities. Therefore, having impingement syndrome of the right shoulder region does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Tenosynovitis of wrist,40481788,False,"No, tenosynovitis of the wrist is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tenosynovitis is inflammation of the tendon sheath, which can be caused by various factors such as overuse, injury, or infection. While tenosynovitis can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the inflammatory nature of the disease, it is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having tenosynovitis of the wrist does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deformity of foot,4047269,True,"Yes, deformity of the foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction can lead to deformities in the small joints of the hands and feet. Deformities such as bunions, claw toes, and hammer toes are common in patients with RA due to the chronic inflammation and joint damage. Therefore, if a patient presents with deformity of the foot, it could be a strong indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Onychia,40483826,False,"No, onychia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Onychia is a condition characterized by inflammation of the nail matrix, leading to pain, swelling, and sometimes pus formation around the nail. While onychia can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the inflammatory nature of the disease, it is not a defining symptom or diagnostic criteria for RA. Therefore, having onychia does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of first metatarsophalangeal joint of left foot,764311,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of first metatarsophalangeal joint of left foot"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetrical and can affect small joints, such as those in the hands and feet. The first metatarsophalangeal joint is located in the foot, and arthritis in this joint can be a manifestation of RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are consistent with arthritis in the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of hand,4307423,False,"No

Rationale: Tendinitis of the hand is a condition characterized by inflammation or irritation of the tendons in the hand, often causing pain and swelling. While tendinitis can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) due to the inflammatory nature of the disease, it is not specific to RA. Tendinitis can also occur in individuals without RA due to overuse, injury, or other factors. Therefore, having tendinitis of the hand does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Medial epicondylitis of right humerus,762283,False,"No

Rationale: Medial epicondylitis, also known as golfer's elbow, is a condition characterized by pain and inflammation on the inner side of the elbow. While it is a specific condition, it is not directly related to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Medial epicondylitis is a localized condition affecting the elbow, and the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic rupture of posterior cruciate ligament of left knee,37108630,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament of the left knee is a specific condition related to a knee injury, and it is not a characteristic symptom or sign of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint pain and swelling are common symptoms of RA, they are not typically associated with a specific ligament rupture in the knee. Therefore, having a chronic rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament of the left knee does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Complication of reattached finger,442791,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Complication of reattached finger"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While it is possible for individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis to experience complications with reattached fingers due to joint involvement and potential deformities, the presence of this condition alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis would need to be assessed for a proper diagnosis."
Medial epicondylitis of left humerus,762282,False,"No

Rationale:
Medial epicondylitis of the left humerus, also known as golfer's elbow, is a condition characterized by pain and inflammation of the tendons on the inner side of the elbow. While this condition can cause discomfort and limited range of motion in the affected arm, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having medial epicondylitis of the left humerus does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic rupture of medial collateral ligament of left knee,37108628,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. A chronic rupture of the medial collateral ligament of the left knee is a specific injury to the ligament in the knee joint and is not a characteristic symptom or feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling in various joints, a chronic rupture of a specific ligament in the knee is not a defining feature of the disease."
Chronic rupture of anterior cruciate ligament of left knee,37108629,False,"No, chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition of chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the left knee is a specific injury to the knee joint and is not a characteristic symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling, a chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament is a separate orthopedic issue that is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic rupture of medial collateral ligament of right knee,37108626,False,"No, chronic rupture of the medial collateral ligament of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition of chronic rupture of the medial collateral ligament of the right knee is a specific injury to the ligament in the knee joint and is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and damage, a chronic rupture of a ligament in a specific joint is not a defining characteristic of the disease."
Palindromic rheumatism,76196,False,"No, palindromic rheumatism is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Palindromic rheumatism is a rare form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent episodes of joint pain, swelling, and stiffness that typically last for a few days to a few weeks before resolving completely. Unlike Rheumatoid Arthritis, palindromic rheumatism does not lead to joint destruction or deformities. While some patients with palindromic rheumatism may go on to develop Rheumatoid Arthritis, not all individuals with palindromic rheumatism will progress to this condition. Therefore, having palindromic rheumatism does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic rupture of posterior cruciate ligament of right knee,37108627,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament of the right knee is a specific condition related to a knee injury, and it is not directly associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling in various joints, including the knee, the specific condition of a chronic rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Neuritis of saphenous nerve,4182422,False,"No, neuritis of the saphenous nerve is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Neuritis of the saphenous nerve refers to inflammation of the saphenous nerve, which can cause symptoms such as pain, numbness, and tingling in the inner part of the knee and lower leg. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can cause nerve inflammation as part of its systemic autoimmune process, neuritis of the saphenous nerve is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having neuritis of the saphenous nerve does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoinflammation-PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency-immune dysregulation,36680582,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, Autoinflammation-PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency-immune dysregulation, is a specific genetic disorder that affects the immune system and causes recurrent episodes of inflammation. It is not directly related to Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions involve inflammation and immune dysregulation, they are distinct entities with different underlying mechanisms and clinical presentations. Therefore, having the condition does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Heberden node,4155797,True,"Yes, a Heberden node is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

A Heberden node is a bony enlargement of the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) that is commonly associated with osteoarthritis. However, in the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, Heberden nodes can also be present due to joint destruction and deformities caused by the chronic inflammatory process affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, if a patient has a Heberden node, they may have Rheumatoid Arthritis, but not all patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis will necessarily have Heberden nodes."
Dianzani autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease,36715420,False,"No, Dianzani autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Dianzani autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal lymphocyte apoptosis, leading to lymphoproliferation and autoimmune manifestations. While both conditions involve autoimmune processes, they are distinct entities with different underlying mechanisms and clinical presentations. Therefore, having Dianzani autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease does not necessarily mean that a person will have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cellulitis of upper limb,42709799,False,"No

Rationale: Cellulitis of the upper limb is a bacterial skin infection that can occur in any individual, regardless of whether they have rheumatoid arthritis. While individuals with rheumatoid arthritis may be at a higher risk for infections due to their compromised immune system from the disease and immunosuppressive medications, the presence of cellulitis of the upper limb does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Infective arthritis of distal interphalangeal joint of finger,40489947,False,"No, the condition ""Infective arthritis of distal interphalangeal joint of finger"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While RA can affect the small joints of the hands, it typically presents with involvement of multiple joints, not just a single distal interphalangeal joint. 

Infective arthritis, on the other hand, is caused by an infection in the joint and can affect any joint in the body, including the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger. This condition is not specific to RA and can occur independently of autoimmune disorders like RA. 

Therefore, having infective arthritis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hyperkalemia,434610,False,"No

Rationale: Hyperkalemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of potassium in the blood. While hyperkalemia can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) due to factors such as kidney dysfunction or the use of certain medications, it is not specific to RA. Hyperkalemia can also occur in a variety of other medical conditions and is not a defining feature of RA. Therefore, having hyperkalemia does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Disorder of right patellofemoral joint,762303,False,"No, a disorder of the right patellofemoral joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a key feature of RA, the specific mention of the right patellofemoral joint disorder does not necessarily point to RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly the small joints of the hands and feet, and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis. The right patellofemoral joint disorder may be more indicative of a localized issue rather than a systemic autoimmune disease like RA. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to definitively diagnose RA in this case."
Osteomyelitis of upper limb,4155787,False,"No, osteomyelitis of the upper limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteomyelitis is a bacterial infection of the bone, which can occur in any bone in the body, including the upper limb. It is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints. While osteomyelitis can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a specific condition that would definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of first carpometacarpal joint of left hand,37108610,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of first carpometacarpal joint of left hand"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is known to primarily affect the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands. The first carpometacarpal joint is located at the base of the thumb, which is a common site for RA to manifest. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in this specific joint, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, the symmetric polyarthritis characteristic of RA can also involve multiple joints, including the carpometacarpal joint. 

Overall, the presence of arthritis in the first carpometacarpal joint of the left hand aligns with the clinical presentation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, making it a specific condition for this malady."
Disorder of left patellofemoral joint,762302,False,"No, a disorder of the left patellofemoral joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a key feature of RA, the specific mention of the left patellofemoral joint disorder does not necessarily point to RA. This condition could be related to other issues such as patellofemoral pain syndrome, patellar instability, or other forms of arthritis like osteoarthritis. RA typically affects multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet, rather than being isolated to a single joint like the patellofemoral joint."
Arthritis of first carpometacarpal joint of right hand,37108611,True,"Yes, the condition of arthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint of the right hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is known to primarily affect the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands. The first carpometacarpal joint is located in the hand and is commonly affected in patients with RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are symptoms that can be present in arthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint of the right hand, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of first metatarsophalangeal joint,40489948,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Infective arthritis of first metatarsophalangeal joint"" refers to an infection in the joint connecting the big toe to the foot. This is a specific condition related to an infection, rather than an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by autoimmune inflammation, infective arthritis is caused by a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection in the joint. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendonitis of right patellar tendon,762301,False,"No

Rationale:
Tendonitis of the right patellar tendon is a condition involving inflammation of the patellar tendon, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may develop tendonitis as a secondary complication, having tendonitis of the right patellar tendon does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, joint swelling, and deformities, which are not directly related to tendonitis of the patellar tendon."
Bilateral arthritis of finger of hand,37108609,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral arthritis of the fingers of the hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). RA is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, meaning that it affects joints on both sides of the body. The presence of bilateral arthritis in the fingers of the hand is a common early manifestation of RA, as described in the malady description. Additionally, the joint involvement in RA often includes the small joints of the hands and feet, which aligns with the condition provided. Therefore, if a person has bilateral arthritis of the fingers of the hand, they are likely to have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Closed fracture of lateral condyle of proximal left tibia,760243,False,"No, a closed fracture of the lateral condyle of the proximal left tibia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A closed fracture is a physical injury to the bone, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may be at a higher risk for fractures due to bone density issues, the presence of a closed fracture does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Paroxysmal hematoma of the finger,4032901,False,"No, paroxysmal hematoma of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Paroxysmal hematoma of the finger refers to sudden episodes of bleeding into the soft tissues of the finger, which can be caused by trauma, vascular abnormalities, or blood clotting disorders. While joint swelling and deformities are common in Rheumatoid Arthritis, paroxysmal hematoma of the finger is not a typical symptom of this condition."
Closed fracture of lateral condyle of proximal right tibia,760242,False,"No, a closed fracture of the lateral condyle of the proximal right tibia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A closed fracture is a physical injury to the bone, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may be at a higher risk for fractures due to joint damage and osteoporosis, the presence of a closed fracture does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Boil of upper limb,4143494,False,"No

Rationale: A boil of the upper limb is a localized skin infection caused by bacteria, typically Staphylococcus aureus. While it is possible for a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) to develop a boil on their upper limb, having a boil of the upper limb is not specific to RA. Boils are not a characteristic symptom or feature of RA, and they can occur in individuals without RA as well. Therefore, the presence of a boil of the upper limb does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Arthritis of right sacroiliac joint,37108618,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of right sacroiliac joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the synovial joints, including the sacroiliac joints. Arthritis of the sacroiliac joint is a common manifestation of RA, as it is a type of arthritis that affects the spine and can lead to inflammation, pain, and stiffness in the lower back and buttocks. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis of the right sacroiliac joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Closed fracture of medial condyle of proximal left tibia,760245,False,"No

Rationale: A closed fracture of the medial condyle of the proximal left tibia is a specific injury to the bone in the leg and is not directly related to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may be at a higher risk for fractures due to decreased bone density from chronic inflammation and medication side effects, the presence of a closed fracture of the medial condyle of the proximal left tibia does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Closed fracture of medial condyle of right proximal tibia,760244,False,"No

Rationale: A closed fracture of the medial condyle of the right proximal tibia is a specific injury to the bone and not a condition associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may be at a higher risk for fractures due to osteoporosis or joint deformities, the presence of a specific fracture does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Arthritis of left sacroiliac joint,37108617,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of left sacroiliac joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, which can include the sacroiliac joints. The presence of arthritis in the sacroiliac joint, especially if it is symmetric and part of a systemic autoimmune disease, can be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, RA often presents with joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness, which can also be seen in arthritis of the sacroiliac joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the left sacroiliac joint, it is likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cellulitis of lower limb,42709838,False,"No

Rationale: Cellulitis of the lower limb is a bacterial skin infection that causes redness, swelling, and warmth in the affected area. While cellulitis can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to this condition. Cellulitis can affect individuals with various underlying health conditions or even healthy individuals. Therefore, having cellulitis of the lower limb does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Synovial plica syndrome of right knee,762305,False,"No, synovial plica syndrome of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovial plica syndrome is a condition where the synovial plica, a fold in the synovial membrane of the knee joint, becomes irritated or inflamed, causing pain and discomfort. It is a separate and distinct condition from Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints with systemic autoimmune inflammation. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially have synovial plica syndrome as a comorbidity, having synovial plica syndrome does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Sacral arthritis,4180469,True,"Yes, sacral arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Sacral arthritis refers to inflammation in the sacroiliac joints, which are the joints connecting the sacrum (the triangular bone at the base of the spine) to the pelvis. In Rheumatoid Arthritis, inflammation can affect multiple joints in the body, including the sacroiliac joints. Therefore, if a person has sacral arthritis, it is likely that it is a manifestation of their Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovial plica syndrome of left knee,762304,False,"No, synovial plica syndrome of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovial plica syndrome is a condition where the synovial plica, a fold in the synovial membrane of the knee joint, becomes irritated or inflamed, causing pain and discomfort. It is a separate and distinct condition from Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints with systemic autoimmune inflammation. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially have synovial plica syndrome as a separate issue, having synovial plica syndrome does not necessarily mean the patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Blood coagulation disorder,432585,False,"No, a blood coagulation disorder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may have an increased risk of developing blood clotting disorders due to inflammation and other factors, having a blood coagulation disorder does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Blood coagulation disorders can be caused by various factors such as genetic conditions, medications, or other underlying health issues unrelated to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of femoral nerve,46273298,False,"No, inflammation of the femoral nerve is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Inflammation of the femoral nerve, also known as femoral neuropathy, can be caused by various factors such as trauma, compression, diabetes, or infections. While inflammation can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not exclusive to this condition and can occur in other medical conditions as well. Therefore, having inflammation of the femoral nerve does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of joint of shoulder region,44782456,False,"No, monoarthritis of the joint of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Monoarthritis refers to inflammation in a single joint, while Rheumatoid Arthritis typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, particularly in the hands and feet. Additionally, the shoulder joint is not one of the most commonly affected joints in RA. Therefore, while monoarthritis of the shoulder region could potentially be a symptom of RA, it is not specific to the malady and could be indicative of other conditions as well."
Inflammation of obturator nerve,46273297,False,"No, inflammation of the obturator nerve is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Inflammation of the obturator nerve can be caused by various factors such as trauma, compression, or infection. While Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, it does not specifically cause inflammation of the obturator nerve. Therefore, having inflammation of the obturator nerve does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hydroxyapatite deposition disease of elbow joint,606687,True,"Yes, the condition of hydroxyapatite deposition disease of the elbow joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Hydroxyapatite deposition disease is a condition characterized by the deposition of calcium crystals in the soft tissues around joints, leading to inflammation and pain. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, joint inflammation and destruction are primarily caused by autoimmune processes affecting the synovial joints. While hydroxyapatite deposition disease can occur in various joints, it is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having hydroxyapatite deposition disease of the elbow joint does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarthritis of joint of ankle,762333,False,"No

Rationale: Rheumatoid Arthritis typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, particularly in the hands and feet. Monoarthritis of the joint of the ankle, involving only one joint, is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can affect the ankle joint, the presence of monoarthritis in this specific joint does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Other conditions such as gout, septic arthritis, or trauma could also present with monoarthritis of the ankle joint."
Polyneuropathy in collagen vascular disease,375260,True,"Yes, polyneuropathy in collagen vascular disease can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a collagen vascular disease, and polyneuropathy can be a complication of this condition. Polyneuropathy refers to damage or dysfunction of multiple peripheral nerves, which can lead to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain in the extremities. In the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, polyneuropathy may result from inflammation and immune system dysfunction affecting the nerves.

Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis presents with polyneuropathy, it is likely specific to their underlying condition. However, it is important to consider other potential causes of polyneuropathy in the differential diagnosis and to further investigate the specific etiology of the nerve damage."
Autoimmune inflammation of skeletal muscle,40483721,False,"No, autoimmune inflammation of skeletal muscle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, autoimmune inflammation of skeletal muscle would be more indicative of a condition such as Myositis or Polymyositis. These conditions involve inflammation of the muscles rather than the joints, which is the primary characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having autoimmune inflammation of skeletal muscle does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of the hand,4114911,False,"No

Rationale: Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gouty arthritis can affect the hands, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by autoimmune inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints, with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings used for diagnosis. Gouty arthritis of the hand may present similarly to RA in terms of joint pain and swelling, but the underlying pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria are different. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Sjögren's syndrome,254443,True,"Yes, Sjögren's syndrome is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth due to lymphocytic infiltration of the lacrimal and salivary glands. It commonly coexists with other autoimmune diseases, such as Rheumatoid Arthritis. In fact, up to 30% of patients with RA also have Sjögren's syndrome. Therefore, if a patient has Sjögren's syndrome, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, not all patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis will have Sjögren's syndrome."
Malignant melanoma of finger,4092372,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Malignant melanoma of the finger is a type of skin cancer that affects the skin cells, specifically melanocytes. While it is possible for a person to have both conditions simultaneously, the presence of malignant melanoma of the finger does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, the condition of malignant melanoma of the finger is not specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Periostitis,440822,False,"No

Rationale:
Periostitis is inflammation of the periosteum, which is the connective tissue that covers the outer surface of bones. While periostitis can be seen in various conditions, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Periostitis can be seen in conditions such as trauma, infection, or repetitive stress injuries. Therefore, having periostitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger,4063690,True,"Yes, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by joint involvement, including the small joints of the hands and feet. The proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers are commonly affected in RA, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and deformities. Therefore, if a patient presents with reactive arthropathy of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of sternoclavicular joint,4063688,True,"Yes, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of sternoclavicular joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Reactive arthropathy refers to joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), joint inflammation is a hallmark feature of the disease. The sternoclavicular joint is a synovial joint that can be affected by RA, leading to symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient has reactive arthropathy of the sternoclavicular joint, it is highly likely that they have RA, as this condition is specific to the malady."
Hip dysplasia Beukes type,36715463,False,"No, hip dysplasia Beukes type is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hip dysplasia Beukes type is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal development of the hip joint, leading to hip dysplasia and early-onset osteoarthritis. It is not associated with the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect joint function and cause pain, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes and mechanisms."
Developmental dislocation of ankle and/or foot,40483729,False,"No, the condition of developmental dislocation of ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Developmental dislocation of ankle and/or foot refers to a congenital condition where the ankle and/or foot joints are abnormally positioned or dislocated from birth. This is a musculoskeletal issue that is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially have issues with their ankles or feet due to joint involvement, the specific condition of developmental dislocation is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis."

Rationale:
Juvenile osteochondrosis of capitulum of humerus is a condition that affects the growth plate in the elbow joint of children and adolescents, leading to pain and limited range of motion. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a separate entity that primarily affects the elbow joint in a younger population. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect multiple joints, including the elbow, the presence of juvenile osteochondrosis of capitulum of humerus does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Neoplasm of skin of finger,4129221,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While it is possible for individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis to develop skin neoplasms, the presence of a neoplasm of the skin of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Skin neoplasms can occur in individuals with various medical conditions or even in the absence of any underlying disease. Therefore, the presence of a neoplasm of the skin of the finger does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Fetal disorder due to maternal autoimmune disease,604661,True,"Yes, the condition of fetal disorder due to maternal autoimmune disease can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease, and maternal autoimmune diseases, including RA, can potentially lead to fetal disorders due to the transfer of autoantibodies and inflammatory mediators across the placenta. This can result in complications such as intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and neonatal lupus syndrome. Therefore, if a pregnant woman has Rheumatoid Arthritis, there is a possibility that it could lead to fetal disorders due to maternal autoimmune disease."
Syndromic multisystem autoimmune disease due to ITCH deficiency,36674515,True,"Yes, the condition ""Syndromic multisystem autoimmune disease due to ITCH deficiency"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: The condition described is a specific genetic disorder that results in a multisystem autoimmune disease, which aligns with the autoimmune nature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, the presence of autoimmune dysfunction due to ITCH deficiency can lead to the chronic inflammatory joint disease characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if an individual has the condition of Syndromic multisystem autoimmune disease due to ITCH deficiency, they would definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ischemic finger,4139579,False,"No

Rationale: Ischemic finger is a condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the finger, leading to symptoms such as pain, numbness, and discoloration. While ischemic finger can be a symptom of various conditions, including vasculitis or Raynaud's disease, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having an ischemic finger does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic folliculitis of legs,4080187,False,"No, chronic folliculitis of legs is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chronic folliculitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of hair follicles, typically caused by bacterial or fungal infections. It is not a known symptom or diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis. While patients with RA may experience skin manifestations, chronic folliculitis is not a common feature of the disease. Therefore, having chronic folliculitis of the legs does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of foot,4137530,False,"No

Rationale: Tendinitis of the foot is a condition involving inflammation of the tendons in the foot, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While foot involvement can occur in RA, tendinitis of the foot is a separate condition that can be caused by various factors such as overuse, injury, or biomechanical issues. Therefore, having tendinitis of the foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ischemic hand,4139577,False,"No, ischemic hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ischemic hand refers to a condition where there is reduced blood flow to the hand, leading to symptoms such as pain, numbness, and coldness. This can be caused by various factors such as arterial embolism, thrombosis, or vasospasm. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can cause inflammation and joint damage in the hands, it is not directly related to reduced blood flow leading to ischemic hand."
Cellulitis of finger,4100662,False,"No

Rationale: Cellulitis of the finger is a bacterial skin infection that can occur in anyone, regardless of whether they have rheumatoid arthritis. While individuals with rheumatoid arthritis may be at a higher risk for infections due to their compromised immune system from the autoimmune disease and potential use of immunosuppressive medications, cellulitis of the finger is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. It is a separate condition that can occur in anyone who experiences a break in the skin on their finger that allows bacteria to enter and cause an infection."
Tendinitis of finger,4172343,False,"No

Rationale: Tendinitis of the finger is a condition characterized by inflammation of the tendons in the finger, typically due to overuse or repetitive movements. While it can cause pain and swelling in the finger joints, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis of the finger can occur in individuals without RA, and RA can present with a variety of symptoms beyond just tendinitis. Therefore, having tendinitis of the finger does not definitively mean that an individual has rheumatoid arthritis."
Wrist pyogenic arthritis,4344398,True,"Yes, wrist pyogenic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic arthritis is a type of joint infection caused by bacteria, which can occur in any joint including the wrist. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the joint inflammation is due to an autoimmune response rather than an infection. Therefore, if a patient has wrist pyogenic arthritis, it is not necessarily indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, if a patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis, they may develop inflammation in the wrist joint as part of the disease process."
Bacterial arthritis of sacroiliac joint,4328019,False,"No, bacterial arthritis of the sacroiliac joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Bacterial arthritis is caused by an infection in the joint, typically due to bacteria entering the joint space through the bloodstream or from a nearby infection. It is not an autoimmune condition like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and inflammation, they have different underlying causes and require different treatment approaches."
PF-ILD-progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease,37208102,False,"No, PF-ILD is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While interstitial lung disease can be a complication of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it can also occur in other autoimmune diseases, environmental exposures, and idiopathic causes. Therefore, having PF-ILD does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Mass of hand,4203095,False,"No, a mass of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint swelling and deformities are common symptoms of RA, a mass of the hand could be indicative of other conditions such as ganglion cysts, lipomas, or even tumors. Therefore, the presence of a mass of the hand alone does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and diagnostic testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of RA."
Degenerative joint disease of ankle AND/OR foot,4219481,False,"No

Rationale: Degenerative joint disease of the ankle and/or foot is a condition that can be caused by various factors such as wear and tear, injury, or other underlying conditions. While rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint destruction and deformities, degenerative joint disease of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. It can be caused by different mechanisms and is not exclusive to RA. Therefore, having degenerative joint disease of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Bilateral derangement of knee,42535058,True,"Yes, bilateral derangement of the knee can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric, meaning that both sides of the body are affected equally. Bilateral derangement of the knee suggests that both knees are affected, which is consistent with the symmetric polyarthritis seen in RA. Additionally, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction are common features of RA, which can lead to derangement of the knee joints. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral derangement of the knee, it is likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finger wrinkling,4031008,False,"No

Rationale: Finger wrinkling is not a specific symptom or sign of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint swelling and deformities are common in RA, finger wrinkling is not a characteristic feature of the disease. Finger wrinkling could be caused by a variety of factors such as prolonged exposure to water or skin conditions, but it is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Acute lymphadenitis of upper limb,4061728,False,"No, acute lymphadenitis of the upper limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute lymphadenitis is an infection and inflammation of the lymph nodes, which can be caused by various factors such as bacterial or viral infections. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with acute lymphadenitis as a specific symptom. Therefore, having acute lymphadenitis of the upper limb does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."

While both conditions can present with joint symptoms, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the right elbow does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of left wrist,37310486,False,"No

Rationale: Infective arthritis of the left wrist is a specific condition related to an infection in the wrist joint, which is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While infectious arthritis can cause joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction similar to RA, the underlying cause is different. RA is an autoimmune disease, whereas infective arthritis is caused by an infection. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the left wrist does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder in remission,35622958,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder in remission"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that can go into remission with appropriate treatment. However, the term ""Disorder in remission"" is a general term that can apply to any medical condition or disorder that is currently not active or causing symptoms. Therefore, while a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience remission, the presence of ""Disorder in remission"" does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune endocrine disease,4028942,False,"No

Rationale: While autoimmune endocrine diseases can coexist with Rheumatoid Arthritis, having an autoimmune endocrine disease does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is specifically characterized by joint involvement, symmetrical polyarthritis, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are not primary features of autoimmune endocrine diseases. Therefore, the presence of an autoimmune endocrine disease does not necessarily indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic rheumatic arthritis,606781,True,"Yes, chronic rheumatic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. The term ""chronic rheumatic arthritis"" is often used interchangeably with Rheumatoid Arthritis, as both refer to a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. The symptoms and characteristics described in the malady align with the condition, making it a specific indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Developmental problem of hand grip coordination,3174917,False,"No, the condition ""Developmental problem of hand grip coordination"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can cause joint pain and swelling in the hands, leading to difficulties with grip coordination, there are many other potential causes for developmental problems of hand grip coordination, such as neurological conditions or developmental disorders. Therefore, having a developmental problem of hand grip coordination does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rheumatic arthritis,606783,False,"No.

Rheumatic arthritis is not a specific condition, and it is likely a misspelling of rheumatoid arthritis. Since rheumatoid arthritis is a specific malady with defined clinical criteria for diagnosis, if someone has rheumatoid arthritis, they may or may not have the condition of rheumatic arthritis. However, if someone has the condition of rheumatic arthritis, it does not definitively mean they have rheumatoid arthritis as it is not a recognized medical term."
Hypertrophy of fat pad of left knee,37310479,False,"No

Rationale: Hypertrophy of the fat pad of the left knee is a specific condition that involves an increase in the size of the fat pad in the knee joint. While this condition may be present in individuals with various knee issues, including rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having hypertrophy of the fat pad of the left knee does not definitively mean that an individual has rheumatoid arthritis."

This condition is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints."
Congenital anomaly of finger,4051577,False,"No, a congenital anomaly of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A congenital anomaly of the finger refers to a structural abnormality present at birth, which is not related to an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA. While individuals with RA may experience joint deformities in the fingers over time due to the disease process, the presence of a congenital anomaly of the finger does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA."
Trochanteric tendinitis,4104825,False,"No, trochanteric tendinitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Trochanteric tendinitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the tendons around the hip, specifically the trochanteric bursa. It typically presents with pain and tenderness on the outside of the hip and can be exacerbated by activities such as walking or climbing stairs. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop trochanteric tendinitis as a secondary issue, having trochanteric tendinitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic synovitis,45766909,True,"Yes, chronic synovitis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chronic synovitis, which is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, is a hallmark feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, chronic synovitis leads to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, contributing to the characteristic symptoms of the disease. Therefore, if a person has chronic synovitis, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Dystonia of left hand,42535105,False,"No

Rationale: Dystonia of the left hand is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures or repetitive movements. While dystonia can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to this condition. Dystonia can be seen in a variety of neurological and movement disorders, so the presence of dystonia of the left hand alone does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Dystonia of right hand,42535104,False,"No, dystonia of the right hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, which can lead to abnormal postures or repetitive movements. While joint involvement is common in Rheumatoid Arthritis, dystonia is not a typical symptom of RA. Dystonia can be caused by various factors such as neurological conditions, medication side effects, or genetic factors. Therefore, having dystonia of the right hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic vesicular eczema of hands and feet,4223498,False,"No, chronic vesicular eczema of hands and feet is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can present with joint pain and swelling in the hands and feet, chronic vesicular eczema is a skin condition characterized by recurrent blistering and inflammation of the skin. Although skin manifestations can occur in RA, chronic vesicular eczema is not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having chronic vesicular eczema of the hands and feet does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deformity of hand,4182643,True,"Yes, deformity of the hand can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction can lead to deformities in the hands, such as swan-neck deformity, boutonniere deformity, and ulnar deviation. These deformities are characteristic of RA and can be a key clinical feature in diagnosing the disease. Therefore, if a patient presents with deformity of the hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of left quadriceps tendon,42539205,False,"No, tendinitis of the left quadriceps tendon is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tendinitis is inflammation of a tendon, which can occur due to overuse, injury, or other factors. While joint pain and inflammation are common symptoms in both tendinitis and Rheumatoid Arthritis, tendinitis is a localized condition affecting the tendon, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having tendinitis of the left quadriceps tendon does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Neoplasm of hand,4131439,False,"No

Rationale: A neoplasm of the hand refers to a tumor or abnormal growth in the hand, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement in RA can lead to deformities in the hands, the presence of a neoplasm in the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Diagnosis of RA is based on specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings, rather than the presence of a neoplasm in the hand."
Bilateral osteoarthritis of feet due to trauma,42535128,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that is not autoimmune in nature. The condition of bilateral osteoarthritis of the feet due to trauma is specific to osteoarthritis caused by trauma, rather than Rheumatoid Arthritis. While some symptoms may overlap, the underlying causes and mechanisms of the two conditions are different."
Fracture dislocation of joint of shoulder girdle,4213266,False,"No, a fracture dislocation of the joint of the shoulder girdle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

A fracture dislocation of the joint of the shoulder girdle is a traumatic injury involving both a fracture and a dislocation of the shoulder joint. This condition is typically caused by a significant force or trauma to the shoulder area. In contrast, Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction.

While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially experience joint fractures or dislocations due to the effects of the disease on the joints, the presence of a fracture dislocation of the joint of the shoulder girdle does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Os acromiale,40482874,False,"No, Os acromiale is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Os acromiale is a condition where the acromion, a bony process on the scapula, fails to fuse properly during development. This can lead to shoulder pain and dysfunction, but it is not directly related to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have Os acromiale, having Os acromiale does not mean that a person definitely has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral gouty arthritis of feet,42535133,False,"No.

Rationale:
Bilateral gouty arthritis of the feet is a specific condition that is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and RA are forms of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder. Additionally, gout typically affects the big toe joint initially and is not symmetric like RA. Therefore, having bilateral gouty arthritis of the feet does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Intersection syndrome,40482876,False,"No, intersection syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Intersection syndrome is a condition characterized by inflammation of the tendons in the forearm, specifically where the tendons cross over each other. It is typically caused by overuse or repetitive motion of the wrist and forearm. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, intersection syndrome is a separate and distinct condition unrelated to RA."
Bilateral arthritis of subtalar joint,42535134,True,"Yes, bilateral arthritis of the subtalar joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric, and arthritis of the subtalar joint can be a manifestation of the disease. Additionally, the presence of arthritis in multiple joints, including the subtalar joint, is consistent with the polyarthritis seen in RA. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral arthritis of the subtalar joint, it may suggest the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty tophus of left hand,42535121,True,"Yes, the condition ""Gouty tophus of left hand"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Gouty tophi are deposits of uric acid crystals that can form in the joints and soft tissues of individuals with gout, a type of arthritis caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood. While gout and Rheumatoid Arthritis are both types of arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and manifestations. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Gout, on the other hand, is caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, redness, and swelling. 

Therefore, the presence of a gouty tophus of the left hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis and could indicate gout rather than RA."
Synovitis of left ankle joint,42539217,True,"Yes, synovitis of the left ankle joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis, which is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, is a common feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is typically symmetric and affects multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, if a patient presents with synovitis of the left ankle joint, it could be indicative of RA, especially if there are other signs and symptoms consistent with the disease. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of synovitis as well."
Gouty tophus of right hand,42535120,False,"No

Rationale: Gouty tophus of the right hand is a specific finding associated with gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint conditions, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Therefore, the presence of a gouty tophus of the right hand does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Transient arthropathy of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger,4117090,False,"No

Rationale: While transient arthropathy of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to this malady. There are many other conditions that can cause transient arthropathy in this joint, such as trauma, infection, or other types of arthritis. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Charcot's joint of foot,4205084,False,"No, Charcot's joint of the foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Charcot's joint, also known as neuropathic arthropathy, is a condition characterized by progressive destruction of a weight-bearing joint, typically in the foot or ankle, due to loss of sensation and proprioception. It is commonly associated with conditions such as diabetes mellitus, syphilis, and other neuropathic disorders. While Charcot's joint can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to this malady and can be seen in other conditions as well."
Transient arthropathy of distal interphalangeal joint of finger,4117091,False,"No, transient arthropathy of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of RA, transient arthropathy of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger is a specific condition affecting that particular joint. It is not a defining characteristic of RA, as RA typically affects multiple joints symmetrically, including the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, having transient arthropathy of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
CRST syndrome,4266527,False,"No, CRST syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. CRST syndrome, also known as limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, is a subtype of systemic sclerosis characterized by skin thickening limited to the face, hands, and feet, as well as Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, and telangiectasias. While both conditions are autoimmune disorders, they have distinct clinical features and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having CRST syndrome does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Closed fracture of condyle of left femur,760430,False,"No, a closed fracture of the condyle of the left femur is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A closed fracture is a physical injury to the bone, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may be at a higher risk for fractures due to joint damage and osteoporosis, the presence of a closed fracture of the condyle of the left femur does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rheumatoid linear subcutaneous bands,4299307,False,"No

Rheumatoid linear subcutaneous bands are not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While they can be seen in some patients with RA, they are not a defining characteristic of the disease. These bands are fibrous tissue that can develop under the skin in patients with longstanding RA, but they can also be seen in other conditions such as scleroderma. Therefore, the presence of rheumatoid linear subcutaneous bands does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of acromioclavicular joint,4323882,False,"No

Rationale: Arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint is a specific type of arthritis that affects the joint between the acromion (part of the scapula) and the clavicle (collarbone). While it is a form of arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, such as those in the hands and feet, and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation. Arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint is a localized condition that does not necessarily indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Psoas tendinitis,4192851,False,"No, psoas tendinitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Psoas tendinitis is inflammation of the psoas muscle tendon, which can cause hip and groin pain. While joint pain is a common symptom in Rheumatoid Arthritis, psoas tendinitis is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having psoas tendinitis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rotator cuff tear arthropathy,4217388,True,"Yes, rotator cuff tear arthropathy is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rotator cuff tear arthropathy is a condition characterized by a combination of rotator cuff tear and arthritis in the shoulder joint. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, chronic inflammation can lead to joint damage and erosion, including in the shoulder joint, which can result in rotator cuff tears and subsequent arthropathy. Therefore, if a patient has rotator cuff tear arthropathy, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of thorax,4043346,False,"No, a disorder of the thorax is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not specifically target the thorax. A disorder of the thorax could be related to a variety of other conditions such as respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, or musculoskeletal disorders unrelated to RA."
Disorder of cervical spine,80497,False,"No

Rationale: A disorder of the cervical spine is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the cervical spine, a disorder of the cervical spine can be caused by various other conditions such as degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, or trauma. Therefore, having a disorder of the cervical spine does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosis of joint of ankle AND/OR foot,80498,True,"Yes, ankylosis of the joint of the ankle and/or foot is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosis refers to the abnormal stiffening and immobility of a joint due to fusion of the bones, which can occur as a result of chronic inflammation and damage in conditions like RA. In RA, the chronic inflammation can lead to joint destruction and deformities, including ankylosis, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosis of the joint of the ankle and/or foot, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of elbow,4323893,False,"No, arthropathy of the elbow is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Arthropathy is a general term for any disease or abnormal condition affecting a joint. While arthropathy of the elbow can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it can also be caused by other conditions such as osteoarthritis, trauma, infection, or inflammatory conditions like gout. Therefore, having arthropathy of the elbow does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral gouty arthritis of ankles,42539261,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described, bilateral gouty arthritis of ankles, is specific to gout, not Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, redness, and swelling. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having bilateral gouty arthritis of ankles does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic arthralgia of temporomandibular joint,42537212,False,"No, chronic arthralgia of the temporomandibular joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the hands and feet, chronic arthralgia of the temporomandibular joint refers to pain and dysfunction in the jaw joint. This condition is more commonly associated with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) or other conditions affecting the jaw joint, rather than RA. Therefore, having chronic arthralgia of the temporomandibular joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis,45768909,True,"Yes, autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare lung disorder characterized by the accumulation of surfactant proteins and lipids within the alveoli, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory symptoms. It has been reported to occur in association with autoimmune conditions such as Rheumatoid Arthritis. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues, including the lungs, leading to the development of autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Therefore, if a patient has autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Medial epicondyle apophysitis of left elbow due to overuse,42539248,False,"No

Rationale: Medial epicondyle apophysitis of the left elbow due to overuse is a condition commonly seen in young athletes, particularly baseball pitchers, gymnasts, and tennis players. It is characterized by pain and tenderness on the inner side of the elbow, which can be exacerbated by activities involving repetitive throwing or gripping. This condition is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis, as it is a localized overuse injury rather than a systemic autoimmune disease affecting multiple joints. While individuals with rheumatoid arthritis may experience joint pain in the elbow, the specific diagnosis of medial epicondyle apophysitis due to overuse is not indicative of rheumatoid arthritis."
Localized osteoarthritis of wrist,762486,False,"No

Rationale: Localized osteoarthritis of the wrist is a specific condition that affects the wrist joint due to wear and tear, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. While it is a form of arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Therefore, having localized osteoarthritis of the wrist does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of left elbow caused by Staphylococcus,37310649,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left elbow caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described, arthritis of the left elbow caused by Staphylococcus, suggests an infection-related arthritis caused by a bacterial infection (Staphylococcus). This is not consistent with the autoimmune nature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Therefore, having arthritis of the left elbow caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left knee caused by Staphylococcus,37310648,False,"No. The condition described, arthritis of the left knee caused by Staphylococcus, is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific cause mentioned in the condition (Staphylococcus infection) is not a characteristic feature of RA. Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints, and the presence of a bacterial infection causing arthritis in a specific joint would not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings specific to RA would need to be considered for a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Lesion of ligaments of foot region,4344519,False,"No

Rationale: A lesion of ligaments of the foot region is a specific condition that may be present in various foot injuries or conditions, such as ligament sprains or tears. While it is possible for someone with Rheumatoid Arthritis to have a lesion of ligaments in the foot region due to the joint inflammation and damage associated with RA, the presence of this condition alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, the condition of a lesion of ligaments of the foot region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Mass of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral hands,36685994,False,"No, a mass of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral hands is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can present with joint swelling in the hands, a mass of subcutaneous tissue could be due to a variety of other conditions such as ganglion cysts, lipomas, or other soft tissue tumors. Further evaluation and imaging studies would be needed to determine the cause of the mass."
Vasculitis of the skin,4182711,False,"No, vasculitis of the skin is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While vasculitis can be seen in patients with RA, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Vasculitis of the skin is a condition characterized by inflammation of blood vessels in the skin, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, medications, or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, having vasculitis of the skin does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of left hip joint due to dysplasia,37310643,False,"No, the condition of Osteoarthritis of the left hip joint due to dysplasia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disease like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the joints and cause pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and treatment approaches. Therefore, having Osteoarthritis of the left hip joint due to dysplasia does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of right hip joint due to dysplasia,37310642,False,"No, the condition of Osteoarthritis of the right hip joint due to dysplasia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disease like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having Osteoarthritis of the right hip joint due to dysplasia does not necessarily mean that a person also has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right knee caused by Staphylococcus,37310645,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right knee caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described, arthritis of the right knee caused by Staphylococcus, suggests an infection-related arthritis rather than an autoimmune condition like Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Infection-related arthritis is typically caused by bacteria such as Staphylococcus, leading to joint inflammation and symptoms similar to other forms of arthritis. However, the underlying cause and mechanism of infection-related arthritis are different from Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis of the right knee caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right elbow caused by Staphylococcus,37310646,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, arthritis of the right elbow caused by Staphylococcus, is a specific type of arthritis caused by a bacterial infection. While arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Arthritis can have many different causes, including infections, trauma, and other autoimmune conditions. Therefore, having arthritis of the right elbow caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acute lymphadenitis of lower limb,4063918,False,"No, acute lymphadenitis of the lower limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute lymphadenitis is an inflammation of the lymph nodes, which can be caused by various infections or inflammatory conditions. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with acute lymphadenitis as a specific symptom. Therefore, having acute lymphadenitis of the lower limb does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Open fracture of left thumb,3170982,False,"No

Rationale: An open fracture of the left thumb is a specific condition related to a traumatic injury to the thumb bone, which is not directly associated with the autoimmune inflammatory disorder of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially experience joint pain and swelling in the thumb, an open fracture is a distinct condition caused by trauma rather than an autoimmune process affecting the joints. Therefore, having an open fracture of the left thumb does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease,4108968,False,"No, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the eyes, skin, and nervous system. It is characterized by inflammation in these areas, leading to symptoms such as vision changes, skin pigmentation changes, and neurological symptoms. While both conditions are autoimmune disorders, they affect different systems in the body and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria."
Ankylosis of right knee joint,37204143,True,"Yes, ankylosis of the right knee joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosis refers to the abnormal stiffening and immobility of a joint due to fusion of the bones, which can occur as a result of chronic inflammation and damage in conditions like RA. In RA, the chronic inflammation can lead to joint destruction and deformities, which can ultimately result in ankylosis of the affected joints. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosis of the right knee joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Genitocrural intertrigo,4221659,False,"No, genitocrural intertrigo is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Genitocrural intertrigo is a skin condition characterized by inflammation and irritation in the skin folds of the groin and genital area. It is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that is Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have genitocrural intertrigo, the presence of genitocrural intertrigo does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Drug-induced necrotizing vasculitis,4291294,False,"No.

Rationale:
Drug-induced necrotizing vasculitis is a condition where inflammation and damage occur in blood vessel walls due to a reaction to certain medications. While rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the joints, drug-induced necrotizing vasculitis involves inflammation of blood vessels. Therefore, having drug-induced necrotizing vasculitis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Primary focal hyperhidrosis of palm of hand,36685966,False,"No, primary focal hyperhidrosis of the palm of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Primary focal hyperhidrosis is a condition characterized by excessive sweating in specific areas of the body, such as the palms, soles of the feet, and underarms, without an underlying medical cause. While some patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience excessive sweating as a symptom, primary focal hyperhidrosis is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having primary focal hyperhidrosis of the palm of the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective polyarthritis caused by bacteria,42534954,False,"No, infective polyarthritis caused by bacteria is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can present with polyarthritis (inflammation in multiple joints), infective polyarthritis is caused by a bacterial infection, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease. The presence of infective polyarthritis caused by bacteria does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional diagnostic criteria such as serological markers and imaging findings specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis would be needed to confirm the diagnosis."
Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia,44783628,False,"No, pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While pulmonary complications can occur in patients with RA, pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia can be caused by a variety of other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, or sleep apnea. Therefore, having pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxia does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune urticaria and/or angioedema,4221673,False,"No, autoimmune urticaria and/or angioedema is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions involve autoimmune processes, they affect different parts of the body and have different presentations. Autoimmune urticaria and/or angioedema typically present with hives and swelling of the skin, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the joints. Additionally, the diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches for these conditions are distinct. Therefore, having autoimmune urticaria and/or angioedema does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pathological dislocation of shoulder region,78507,False,"No

Rationale: Pathological dislocation of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint deformities and functional impairment can occur in RA, shoulder dislocation is not a common feature of the disease. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly in the hands and feet, and does not typically lead to shoulder dislocation. Therefore, the presence of pathological dislocation of the shoulder region does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic rheumatic carditis,606883,False,"No, chronic rheumatic carditis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chronic rheumatic carditis is a complication of acute rheumatic fever, which is caused by group A streptococcal infection. It is characterized by inflammation of the heart, particularly the valves, and can lead to valvular damage. While both Rheumatoid Arthritis and chronic rheumatic carditis involve inflammation, they are distinct conditions with different etiologies and pathophysiologies."
Loose body in joint of ankle and/or foot,78509,False,"No, the presence of a loose body in the joint of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A loose body in the joint is typically associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis, traumatic injury, or osteochondritis dissecans. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint damage and deformities, the presence of a loose body in the joint is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Spontaneous bleeding of digits,3170973,False,"No, spontaneous bleeding of digits is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can cause joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, leading to deformities and functional impairment, spontaneous bleeding of digits is not a common or specific symptom of RA. This symptom may be more indicative of other conditions such as coagulopathies or vascular disorders. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to determine the underlying cause of spontaneous bleeding of digits."
Chronic infective polyarthritis,4172431,False,"No, chronic infective polyarthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chronic infective polyarthritis refers to a chronic infection in multiple joints, which can be caused by various infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi. While Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, chronic infective polyarthritis is caused by infections rather than autoimmune processes. Therefore, having chronic infective polyarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tuberculosis of limb bones,432816,False,"No

Rationale: Tuberculosis of limb bones is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tuberculosis of limb bones is a separate condition caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, which primarily affects the bones and joints. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different etiologies and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having tuberculosis of limb bones does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finding of finger joint,4184709,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Finding of finger joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is a key feature, and the small joints of the hands are commonly affected, leading to symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and deformities. Therefore, if a person has the condition of ""Finding of finger joint,"" it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acquired deformity of finger,78524,True,"Yes, an acquired deformity of the finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction and deformities are common due to chronic inflammation and damage to the synovial joints. Deformities such as swan neck deformity, boutonniere deformity, and ulnar deviation of the fingers are characteristic of RA. Therefore, if a patient presents with an acquired deformity of the finger, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause."
Callosity on hand,4192897,False,"No

Rationale: Callosity on the hand is a thickened area of skin caused by repeated friction or pressure. While it may be present in individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint deformities and functional impairment, it is not specific to RA and can be caused by various other factors such as manual labor or use of tools. Therefore, the presence of callosity on the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of abdominal wall,36685969,False,"No, a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be seen in RA, they are not a defining characteristic of the disease. Nodules in RA are typically found in areas of pressure or trauma, such as the elbows or fingers, rather than the abdominal wall. Additionally, nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Trigonocephaly with broad thumb syndrome,36714639,False,"No.

Rationale:
Trigonocephaly with broad thumb syndrome is a rare genetic condition characterized by the premature fusion of the metopic suture of the skull, resulting in a triangular-shaped head (trigonocephaly), and broad thumbs. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) as it is a genetic disorder affecting the skull and thumbs, rather than the joints as seen in RA. While a patient with RA may potentially have trigonocephaly with broad thumb syndrome, the presence of this genetic condition does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of toe of left foot,36686063,False,"No

Rationale: While nodules of subcutaneous tissue can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are not specific to this condition. Nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the toe of the left foot does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Aseptic necrosis of left lateral femoral condyle,42534985,True,"Yes, aseptic necrosis of the left lateral femoral condyle can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Aseptic necrosis, also known as avascular necrosis, is a condition where there is a loss of blood supply to a bone, leading to bone death. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic inflammation and destruction of joints can lead to aseptic necrosis in various joints, including the femoral condyles. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops aseptic necrosis in the left lateral femoral condyle, it can be considered specific to the malady."
Neutropenia associated with autoimmune disease,4008700,True,"Yes, neutropenia associated with autoimmune disease can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Neutropenia, which is a low level of neutrophils in the blood, can be a common finding in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the autoimmune nature of the disease. In RA, the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, including the bone marrow where neutrophils are produced. Therefore, if a patient with RA presents with neutropenia, it is highly likely that it is specifically related to their Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Subungual hematoma, hand",4164350,False,"No, a subungual hematoma in the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

A subungual hematoma is a collection of blood underneath the nail, typically caused by trauma to the nail bed. It is not a characteristic symptom or sign of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may experience joint pain and swelling in the hands, a subungual hematoma is not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having a subungual hematoma in the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left lower leg,36686062,False,"No

Rationale: While nodules of subcutaneous tissue can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are not specific to this condition. Nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout, granuloma annulare, or even as a result of trauma. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the left lower leg does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Aseptic necrosis of right lateral femoral condyle,42534984,True,"Yes, aseptic necrosis of the right lateral femoral condyle can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Aseptic necrosis, also known as avascular necrosis, is a condition where there is a loss of blood supply to a bone, leading to bone death. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic inflammation and autoimmune response can lead to damage in the joints, including the femoral condyles. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops aseptic necrosis in the right lateral femoral condyle, it can be attributed to their underlying condition."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left lower limb,36686061,False,"No, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left lower limb"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be seen in some cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are not a defining characteristic of the disease. Nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or even benign lipomas. Therefore, the presence of a nodule in the subcutaneous tissue of the left lower limb does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of elbow due to renal impairment,46270464,False,"No

Rationale:
Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. Gout typically affects the big toe but can also involve other joints such as the elbow. Renal impairment can contribute to the development of gout due to decreased excretion of uric acid by the kidneys. However, gout is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. While both conditions can involve joint pain and inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having gout of the elbow due to renal impairment does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left hand,36686060,False,"No, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left hand"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition and can be seen in other diseases as well. In RA, nodules typically develop over pressure points or areas of trauma, such as the extensor surfaces of the forearms, elbows, and hands. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue in the left hand alone is not enough to definitively diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed for a proper diagnosis of RA."
Gout of hand due to renal impairment,46270465,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Gout, on the other hand, is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both conditions can affect the hands, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Gout is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a separate condition with distinct diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches. Additionally, the presence of renal impairment in this specific case suggests a different etiology for the gout, further supporting that it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left forearm,36686059,False,"No, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left forearm"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition and can be present in other diseases such as gout or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Therefore, the presence of a nodule in the subcutaneous tissue of the left forearm does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and diagnostic criteria specific to RA would be needed to confirm the diagnosis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of ankle and/or foot,46270470,False,"No

Rationale: Primary chronic gout without tophus of ankle and/or foot is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a metabolic disorder characterized by recurrent acute attacks of inflammatory arthritis due to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and other tissues. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of ankle and/or foot does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left foot,36686058,False,"No, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left foot"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition and can be present in other diseases as well. In RA, nodules typically develop in areas of repeated pressure or trauma, such as the elbows or fingers, rather than the foot. Therefore, the presence of a nodule in the subcutaneous tissue of the left foot alone is not enough to definitively diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of RA."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of hand,46270471,False,"No

Rationale: Primary chronic gout without tophus of hand is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of acute inflammatory arthritis due to deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and soft tissues. While gout can present with joint pain, swelling, and inflammation similar to RA, the underlying pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria are different. Gout is caused by hyperuricemia leading to urate crystal deposition, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of hand does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Disorder of soft tissue of upper limb,4090616,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of soft tissue of upper limb"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, it is not limited to soft tissue disorders of the upper limb. RA is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which can affect multiple joints throughout the body, not just the upper limb. Therefore, having a disorder of soft tissue in the upper limb does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of finger of left hand,36686057,True,"Yes, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of finger of left hand"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis can present with subcutaneous nodules, which are firm, non-tender lumps that can develop under the skin, typically over bony prominences or areas subject to pressure. These nodules are a characteristic feature of RA and can help in the diagnosis of the disease. Therefore, if a patient has nodules of subcutaneous tissue on the finger of the left hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Fingertip eczema,4270726,False,"No, fingertip eczema is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Fingertip eczema is a skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin on the fingertips. It is a common condition that can be caused by various factors such as allergies, irritants, or genetics. While some patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have fingertip eczema, having fingertip eczema does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and medical history when assessing for Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left upper limb,36686056,False,"No, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left upper limb"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition and can be present in other diseases as well. In RA, nodules typically develop over bony prominences or areas of repeated trauma, such as the elbows. Therefore, the presence of a nodule in the subcutaneous tissue of the left upper limb alone is not enough to definitively diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of RA."
Osteoarthritis of right foot,36712696,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is different from rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right foot does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of vertebra,46270474,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, primary chronic gout without tophus of vertebra, is specific to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe attacks of pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of vertebra does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Phlebitis of lower limb vein,441039,False,"No

Rationale:
Phlebitis of a lower limb vein is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Phlebitis refers to inflammation of a vein, typically due to a blood clot or infection. While inflammation can be a feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, phlebitis is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having phlebitis of a lower limb vein does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reverse Hill-Sachs lesion,4117239,False,"No

Rationale:
A Reverse Hill-Sachs lesion is a specific finding seen in cases of shoulder instability, particularly in cases of posterior shoulder dislocation. It is not a condition specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While patients with RA may experience joint pain and swelling in various joints, including the shoulder, the presence of a Reverse Hill-Sachs lesion is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having a Reverse Hill-Sachs lesion does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral forearms,36686054,False,"No

Rationale: While nodules of subcutaneous tissue can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are not specific to this condition. Nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout, systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain infections. Therefore, the presence of nodules of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral forearms does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of left foot,36712697,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is different from rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left foot does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Mechanical failure of right knee prosthetic joint,42534976,False,"No, the condition ""Mechanical failure of right knee prosthetic joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Mechanical failure of a prosthetic joint typically indicates a problem with the artificial joint itself, such as loosening, wear and tear, or fracture, rather than being directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder of RA. While individuals with RA may undergo joint replacement surgery, the mechanical failure of the prosthetic joint is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of wrist,46270475,False,"No

Rationale: Primary chronic gout without tophus of wrist is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperuricemia and the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and other tissues, leading to acute and chronic arthritis. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of wrist does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of finger of bilateral hands,36686053,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of finger of bilateral hands"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is known to cause subcutaneous nodules, which are firm, non-tender lumps that can develop under the skin, typically over bony prominences or areas subject to pressure. These nodules are commonly found in the fingers and hands of individuals with RA. Therefore, if a person presents with nodules of subcutaneous tissue in the fingers of both hands, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of knee,46270472,False,"No.

Rationale:
Primary chronic gout without tophus of knee is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of acute inflammatory arthritis due to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and other tissues. While gout can present with joint pain, swelling, and inflammation similar to RA, it is a distinct condition with different underlying pathophysiology. Gout is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, leading to the formation of urate crystals, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of knee does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral upper limbs,36686052,False,"No

Rationale: While nodules of subcutaneous tissue can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are not specific to this condition. Nodules can also be present in other conditions such as gout, systemic lupus erythematosus, or even in non-rheumatologic conditions. Therefore, the presence of nodules of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral upper limbs alone is not specific enough to definitively diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Old complete tear medial collateral ligament,4117234,False,"No

Rationale: An old complete tear of the medial collateral ligament is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint damage and deformities can occur in RA, a specific tear of the medial collateral ligament is not a defining characteristic of the disease. This condition could be a result of trauma or other factors unrelated to RA."
Cellulitis of digit,76492,False,"No

Rationale: Cellulitis of digit is a localized bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissues, typically caused by Staphylococcus or Streptococcus bacteria. While cellulitis can cause joint pain and swelling in the affected area, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, with characteristic features such as symmetric polyarthritis, joint destruction, and systemic involvement. Therefore, having cellulitis of a digit does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary angiitis of central nervous system,44783716,False,"No

Rationale: Primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord. While both conditions involve autoimmune inflammation, they affect different parts of the body (joints vs. blood vessels in the central nervous system) and have distinct diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having primary angiitis of the central nervous system does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Kashin-Bek disease,72401,False,"No, Kashin-Bek disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Kashin-Bek disease, also known as osteoarthropathy, is a chronic, endemic, deforming osteoarthritis caused by the ingestion of grains contaminated with a specific mold. It primarily affects the joints of the hands and feet, leading to deformities and functional impairment similar to RA. However, the etiology and pathophysiology of Kashin-Bek disease are different from RA, as it is not an autoimmune disorder. Therefore, having Kashin-Bek disease does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of head,36686078,False,"No, a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the head is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition and can be present in other diseases as well. In RA, nodules typically develop in areas of repeated pressure or trauma, such as the elbows or fingers, rather than the head. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the head alone is not enough to definitively diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hemarthrosis of the ankle and/or foot,72403,True,"Yes, hemarthrosis of the ankle and/or foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hemarthrosis, which is bleeding into a joint, can occur in patients with RA due to the inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints characteristic of the disease. In RA, the synovial lining of the joints becomes inflamed and thickened, leading to increased blood vessel fragility and potential bleeding into the joint space. Therefore, if a patient presents with hemarthrosis of the ankle and/or foot, it could be a specific indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of chest wall,36686077,False,"No

Rationale: While nodules of subcutaneous tissue can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are not specific to this condition. Nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout, sarcoidosis, or infections. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of back,36686076,False,"No

Rationale: While nodules of subcutaneous tissue can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are not specific to this condition. Nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout, systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain infections. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the back does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Degenerative joint disease of shoulder region,72405,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While degenerative joint disease of the shoulder region may present with similar symptoms such as joint pain and stiffness, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Degenerative joint disease of the shoulder region is more commonly associated with osteoarthritis, which is a different condition than Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having degenerative joint disease of the shoulder region does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of toe of right foot,36686075,False,"No

Rationale: While nodules of subcutaneous tissue can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are not specific to this condition. Nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and rheumatic fever. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the toe of the right foot does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right lower leg,36686074,False,"No, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right lower leg"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be seen in some cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are not a defining characteristic of the disease. Nodules in the subcutaneous tissue of the lower leg can be seen in a variety of conditions, including but not limited to gout, lipomas, cysts, or infections. Therefore, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Effusion of joint of shoulder region,72407,True,"Yes, effusion of the joint of the shoulder region can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Effusion, or swelling, of the joints is a common symptom of RA due to the inflammation and synovial fluid accumulation in the affected joints. In RA, this effusion is often accompanied by joint pain, stiffness, and tenderness, which are also characteristic symptoms of the disease. Therefore, if a patient presents with effusion of the joint of the shoulder region along with other symptoms suggestive of RA, it is likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Partial thenar atrophy,4227734,True,"Yes, partial thenar atrophy can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, inflammation in the joints can lead to compression of the median nerve in the wrist, resulting in symptoms such as partial thenar atrophy (wasting of the muscles at the base of the thumb). This can be a specific sign of RA, as it is a result of the disease process affecting the nerves and muscles in the hand. However, it is important to consider other potential causes of thenar atrophy, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, before definitively linking it to RA."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right lower limb,36686073,False,"No, a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the right lower limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be seen in some cases of RA, they are not a defining characteristic of the disease. Nodules in RA are typically found over pressure points or areas of trauma, such as the elbows or fingers, rather than the lower limb. Additionally, the presence of a nodule in the subcutaneous tissue of the right lower limb could be indicative of other conditions such as lipomas, cysts, or infections. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to determine the underlying cause of the nodule in this specific location."
Anemia in chronic kidney disease,45768812,False,"No, anemia in chronic kidney disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Anemia in chronic kidney disease is a common complication of kidney dysfunction, where the kidneys are unable to produce enough erythropoietin to stimulate red blood cell production. While anemia can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to chronic inflammation and the use of certain medications, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having anemia in chronic kidney disease does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right hand,36686072,False,"No, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right hand"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition and can be present in other diseases such as gout or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the right hand does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right forearm,36686071,False,"No, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right forearm"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition. Nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and rheumatoid nodules in systemic lupus erythematosus. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the right forearm does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Dactylitis of finger,46270490,True,"Yes, dactylitis of the finger is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Dactylitis, also known as ""sausage digit,"" is a characteristic finding in RA where there is inflammation and swelling of an entire digit, typically the finger. This condition is commonly seen in RA due to the synovial inflammation and joint involvement that is characteristic of the disease. Therefore, if a patient presents with dactylitis of the finger, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right foot,36686070,False,"No

Rationale: A nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the right foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can present with nodules known as rheumatoid nodules, these are typically found over pressure points or areas of trauma, such as the elbows or fingers, rather than the foot. Additionally, the presence of a nodule alone is not enough to definitively diagnose RA, as it is just one of many possible symptoms of the disease. Further evaluation and consideration of other clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings are necessary to diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acute osteomyelitis of hip,4115172,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute osteomyelitis of the hip is a bacterial infection of the bone, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop acute osteomyelitis of the hip as a complication, having acute osteomyelitis of the hip does not definitively mean that the patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis. These are two separate conditions with different etiologies and diagnostic criteria."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of finger of right hand,36686069,True,"Yes, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of finger of right hand"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are a common extra-articular manifestation of RA, typically found in areas of pressure or trauma such as the fingers. These nodules are firm, non-tender, subcutaneous masses that can vary in size. Therefore, if a patient presents with a nodule of subcutaneous tissue on the finger of their right hand, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right upper limb,36686068,False,"No

Rationale: A nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the right upper limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be seen in some cases of RA, they are not a defining characteristic of the disease. Other conditions such as gout or infections can also present with subcutaneous nodules. Therefore, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cyst of meniscus of right knee,37310681,False,"No

Rationale:
A cyst of the meniscus of the right knee is a specific condition related to the knee joint, which is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and can involve multiple joints, the presence of a cyst of the meniscus in the right knee does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. RA is diagnosed based on a combination of clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings specific to the disease, rather than a single localized condition in one joint."
Tenosynovitis of foot,443111,False,"No, tenosynovitis of the foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tenosynovitis is inflammation of the tendon sheath, which can occur in various conditions such as overuse injuries, infection, or inflammatory conditions like RA. While tenosynovitis can be a symptom of RA, it is not exclusive to RA and can occur in other conditions as well. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to definitively diagnose RA in a patient presenting with tenosynovitis of the foot."
Foreign body - finger,4170462,False,"No

Rationale: The presence of a foreign body in the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and presents with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, the presence of a foreign body in the finger is a separate issue that can occur due to trauma or accidental injury. It is important to address the foreign body to prevent infection and other complications, but it is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cyst of meniscus of left knee,37310682,False,"No, a cyst of the meniscus of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A cyst of the meniscus is a fluid-filled sac that can develop in the knee joint due to a tear in the meniscus or other knee injuries. It is a separate condition from RA, which primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by autoimmune inflammation. While a person with RA may potentially develop a cyst of the meniscus as a secondary issue, having a cyst of the meniscus does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral lower limbs,36686027,True,"Yes, the condition of nodules of subcutaneous tissue of bilateral lower limbs is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: Nodules of subcutaneous tissue, also known as rheumatoid nodules, are a common extra-articular manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis. These nodules typically develop in areas of repeated pressure or trauma, such as the extensor surfaces of the forearms, elbows, and Achilles tendons. While they can occur in other locations, the presence of nodules in the subcutaneous tissue of the lower limbs, especially bilaterally, is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient presents with this specific condition, it is very likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune liver disease,4340391,False,"No, autoimmune liver disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions are autoimmune disorders, they affect different organs and have distinct clinical presentations. Autoimmune liver disease primarily affects the liver, leading to inflammation and damage to liver cells, while Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the joints. Therefore, having autoimmune liver disease does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis, and vice versa."
Reattached finger(s) complication,80617,False,"No

Rationale: The condition of reattached finger(s) complication is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may have had a finger reattachment procedure due to joint damage or deformities caused by the disease, the presence of a reattached finger(s) complication does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other factors and medical history when assessing the relationship between the condition and the malady."
Arthritis of left knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,37310673,False,"No, arthritis of the left knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while arthritis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacterial infection leading to joint inflammation. The presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae as the cause of arthritis in the left knee indicates an infectious etiology rather than an autoimmune one, which is characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis of the left knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,37310672,False,"No, arthritis of the right knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while arthritis of the right knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is a specific type of arthritis caused by a bacterial infection. The presence of a bacterial infection as the cause of arthritis in this case indicates a different etiology than Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune condition. Therefore, having arthritis of the right knee caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss,4176595,False,"No

Rationale: Autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While autoimmune conditions can be associated with RA, autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss is a separate condition that can occur independently of RA. It is important to consider other factors and medical history when evaluating a patient with autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss."
Xerostomia due to autoimmune disease,45768790,True,"Yes, xerostomia due to autoimmune disease can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale:
Xerostomia, or dry mouth, can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, the autoimmune response can affect the salivary glands, leading to decreased saliva production and resulting in xerostomia. Therefore, if a patient presents with xerostomia due to an autoimmune disease, it is possible that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of xerostomia and to perform further evaluation and testing to confirm the diagnosis of RA."
Tendinitis of knee,4178642,False,"No, tendinitis of the knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tendinitis is inflammation of a tendon, which can occur in various joints due to overuse, injury, or other factors. While joint pain and inflammation can be symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis, tendinitis of the knee is a separate condition that can occur independently of RA. It is important to consider other factors and diagnostic criteria when assessing for Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of bilateral elbows,760570,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of bilateral elbows does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left knee caused by Streptococcus,37208262,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left knee caused by Streptococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints, while arthritis caused by Streptococcus is typically a result of a bacterial infection. While both conditions can present with joint pain and swelling, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Therefore, having arthritis of the left knee caused by Streptococcus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right knee caused by Streptococcus,37208261,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is not specifically caused by Streptococcus bacteria. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, while arthritis caused by Streptococcus is typically a result of an infection. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms."
Reattached thumb complication,4170444,False,"No, a reattached thumb complication is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. A reattached thumb complication, on the other hand, is a specific complication related to a surgical procedure to reattach a severed thumb. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can lead to joint deformities and functional impairment, a reattached thumb complication is a separate issue related to the surgical procedure itself. Therefore, having a reattached thumb complication does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Soft tissue lesion,4344497,False,"No, a soft tissue lesion is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Soft tissue lesions can be caused by a variety of factors such as trauma, infection, inflammation, or tumors. While soft tissue lesions can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to inflammation in the joints and surrounding tissues, they are not exclusive to this condition. Therefore, having a soft tissue lesion does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Abscess of skin with lymphangitis of digit,4330174,False,"No

Rationale: An abscess of the skin with lymphangitis of the digit is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with abscesses of the skin or lymphangitis. This condition is more likely related to a localized infection rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA."
Fracture of coracoid process of scapula,4174655,False,"No

Rationale: A fracture of the coracoid process of the scapula is a specific injury to the shoulder bone and is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may be at a higher risk for fractures due to joint damage and osteoporosis, the presence of a fracture of the coracoid process of the scapula does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chondrodysplasia punctata due to maternal autoimmune disease,619276,False,"No.

Chondrodysplasia punctata is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal development of cartilage and bone, leading to skeletal abnormalities. It is not directly related to autoimmune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis. While maternal autoimmune disease may potentially have an impact on the fetus, there is no direct correlation between chondrodysplasia punctata and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having chondrodysplasia punctata due to maternal autoimmune disease does not specifically indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Old tear of posterior horn of medial meniscus,4148018,False,"No, an old tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. An old tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus is a specific injury to the knee joint, which is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in RA. While individuals with RA may also have knee injuries such as meniscal tears, the presence of an old tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Arthritis of right elbow caused by bacteria,42539396,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis of the right elbow caused by bacteria suggests an infectious etiology. While RA can affect multiple joints symmetrically, it is not specifically caused by bacteria. Therefore, having arthritis of the right elbow caused by bacteria does not necessarily mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Psoriatic arthritis with spine involvement,4064048,True,"Yes, psoriatic arthritis with spine involvement is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that can affect the spine, among other joints. However, spine involvement is more commonly associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, particularly in the form of cervical spine involvement leading to instability and potential neurological complications. Therefore, if a patient has psoriatic arthritis with spine involvement, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pes anserinus tendinitis,193293,False,"No

Rationale:
Pes anserinus tendinitis is inflammation of the tendons of the pes anserinus, which is a conjoined tendon formed by the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles. This condition typically presents with pain and tenderness on the medial aspect of the knee, just below the joint line. While pes anserinus tendinitis can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Therefore, having pes anserinus tendinitis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Psoriasis plantaris,4064049,True,"Yes, Psoriasis plantaris is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Psoriasis plantaris, also known as palmoplantar psoriasis, is a type of psoriasis that affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It is a chronic autoimmune skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches on the palms and soles. Psoriasis is known to be associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, as both are autoimmune diseases. In fact, individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis are at an increased risk of developing psoriasis, including psoriasis plantaris. Therefore, if a person has Psoriasis plantaris, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infection of finger,4100908,False,"No

Rationale:
An infection of the finger is a general condition that can occur due to various reasons such as bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. While it is possible for a person with rheumatoid arthritis to develop an infection of the finger, the presence of an infection of the finger does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the condition of an infection of the finger is not specific to the malady of rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic disease of immune function,4188970,True,"Yes, the condition ""Chronic disease of immune function"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder, meaning it is a chronic disease of immune function where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues. Therefore, if someone has a chronic disease of immune function, they may definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deltoid tendinitis,4115237,False,"No, deltoid tendinitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Deltoid tendinitis is inflammation of the deltoid muscle tendon, which can cause pain and limited range of motion in the shoulder. While shoulder pain can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, deltoid tendinitis is a separate condition that can be caused by overuse, injury, or degenerative changes in the shoulder. Therefore, having deltoid tendinitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune bullous dermatosis,36716818,False,"No

Rationale:
Autoimmune bullous dermatosis is a group of rare autoimmune skin disorders characterized by the presence of blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. While autoimmune conditions can coexist with rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of autoimmune bullous dermatosis does not specifically indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having autoimmune bullous dermatosis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of left thumb,36686092,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis can present with subcutaneous nodules, typically located over pressure points or areas subject to repeated trauma, such as the elbows, fingers, or Achilles tendon. However, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the left thumb alone is not specific enough to definitively diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings are needed to confirm the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right thumb,36686091,False,"No, the condition ""Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of right thumb"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not specific to this condition and can be present in other conditions as well. In RA, nodules typically develop in areas of repeated pressure or trauma, such as the elbows or fingers, but they are not exclusive to RA. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue in the right thumb does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of neck,36686080,False,"No, a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the neck is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be seen in RA, they are not a defining characteristic of the disease. Nodules in RA are typically found in areas of pressure or trauma, such as the elbows or fingers, rather than the neck. Additionally, nodules can also be seen in other conditions such as gout or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the neck does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune myopathy,36716807,True,"Yes, autoimmune myopathy can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: Autoimmune myopathy is a condition characterized by muscle weakness due to an autoimmune attack on muscle fibers. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, autoimmune myopathy can be a manifestation of the systemic autoimmune process affecting not only the joints but also the muscles. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis presents with autoimmune myopathy, it is highly likely that the two conditions are related."
Articular cartilage disorder,439103,False,"No, an articular cartilage disorder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While articular cartilage damage can occur in Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint inflammation and destruction, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Articular cartilage disorders can also be seen in other conditions such as osteoarthritis, trauma, or overuse injuries. Therefore, the presence of an articular cartilage disorder does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Recurrent dislocation of interphalangeal joint,4117253,False,"No

Rationale: Recurrent dislocation of the interphalangeal joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint deformities and functional impairment are common in RA, recurrent dislocation of the interphalangeal joint can be caused by various factors such as trauma, ligament laxity, or other underlying joint conditions. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Neoplasm of blood vessel of finger,4131588,False,"No, the condition ""Neoplasm of blood vessel of finger"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop various extra-articular manifestations, including vasculitis, the presence of a neoplasm of a blood vessel in the finger is not a defining characteristic of RA. This condition may be more indicative of other underlying issues such as vascular tumors or other vascular disorders. Additional evaluation and testing would be necessary to determine the cause of the neoplasm in this case."
Chronic gouty arthritis,4285308,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic gouty arthritis is a condition characterized by recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis due to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and other tissues. While both chronic gouty arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes and pathophysiology. Therefore, having chronic gouty arthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Injury of shoulder region,76611,False,"No, an injury of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint pain and swelling are common symptoms of RA, an injury to the shoulder region can be caused by a variety of factors such as trauma, overuse, or other medical conditions unrelated to RA. It is important to consider the specific symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and medical history of the individual to determine if the injury of the shoulder region is related to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Multiple dislocations with dysplasia,4109180,True,"Yes, the condition of multiple dislocations with dysplasia is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is known to cause joint deformities and destruction, which can lead to multiple dislocations. Additionally, dysplasia refers to abnormal development or growth of tissues, which can also be seen in the joints affected by RA. Therefore, if a person has multiple dislocations with dysplasia, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Complete tear, ankle and/or foot ligament",4019070,False,"No

Rationale: A complete tear of an ankle and/or foot ligament is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint pain and swelling can be symptoms of RA, a ligament tear is a separate injury that can occur due to trauma or overuse. It is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis,4305666,False,"No.

Rationale:
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a rare autoimmune condition characterized by inflammation of small to medium-sized blood vessels and the presence of eosinophils in tissues. While EGPA can present with joint pain and swelling, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The two conditions have different underlying pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having EGPA does not necessarily mean that a person has RA."
Acute arthritis,4000634,False,"No

Rationale: Acute arthritis is a general term used to describe sudden onset joint inflammation, which can be caused by various conditions such as infection, crystal deposition, or trauma. While acute arthritis can be a symptom of rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA as it can also occur in other types of arthritis or joint conditions. Therefore, having acute arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Brachial neuritis,375631,False,"No, brachial neuritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Brachial neuritis, also known as Parsonage-Turner syndrome, is a rare condition characterized by sudden onset of severe shoulder pain followed by weakness and atrophy of the shoulder and arm muscles. It is believed to be caused by inflammation of the brachial plexus, a network of nerves that control the muscles of the shoulder, arm, and hand. While brachial neuritis can sometimes be associated with autoimmune conditions, it is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Eczema of finger,4297483,False,"No

Rationale: Eczema of the finger is a skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin on the fingers. While it is possible for individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis to also have eczema, the presence of eczema of the finger does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Eczema is a skin condition, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the joints. Therefore, having eczema of the finger does not necessarily mean that an individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of wrist,4035441,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis of the wrist is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the wrist joint, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. While osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis both involve joint pain and stiffness, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the wrist does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Adult osteochondritis of spine,4289292,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While it can affect the spine, it typically involves the small joints of the hands and feet initially. Adult osteochondritis of the spine, on the other hand, is a condition characterized by a lack of blood supply to a segment of bone in the spine, leading to bone death and potential collapse. While both conditions can affect the spine, they are distinct entities with different pathophysiology and clinical presentations. Therefore, having adult osteochondritis of the spine does not necessarily mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Peroneal tendinitis,4180849,False,"No

Rationale: Peroneal tendinitis is inflammation of the peroneal tendons, which are located on the outer side of the lower leg and foot. While peroneal tendinitis can cause pain and swelling in the affected area, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Peroneal tendinitis is more commonly associated with overuse or injury, rather than being a characteristic symptom of RA. Therefore, having peroneal tendinitis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Mechanical failure of left knee prosthetic joint,36712802,False,"No

Rationale: The condition of mechanical failure of a left knee prosthetic joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may require joint replacement surgery, the mechanical failure of a prosthetic joint can occur for various reasons unrelated to RA, such as infection, wear and tear, or trauma. Therefore, having a mechanical failure of a left knee prosthetic joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contact dermatitis of hand,4297490,False,"No

Rationale:
Contact dermatitis of the hand is a localized inflammatory reaction of the skin caused by exposure to irritants or allergens. While it can cause symptoms such as redness, itching, and swelling in the hands, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Contact dermatitis is a skin condition, whereas rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the joints. Therefore, having contact dermatitis of the hand does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Juvenile reactive arthritis,4035428,False,"No, juvenile reactive arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile reactive arthritis, also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, is a distinct condition characterized by joint inflammation in children under the age of 16. It is not the same as Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting adults. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having juvenile reactive arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tenosynovitis of fingers,4344603,True,"Yes, tenosynovitis of fingers can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tenosynovitis is inflammation of the tendon sheath, which can commonly occur in patients with RA due to the inflammatory nature of the disease affecting the synovial joints. In RA, tenosynovitis of fingers can present as pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the fingers, which are characteristic symptoms of the condition. Therefore, if a patient has tenosynovitis of fingers, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Shoulder synovitis,4035431,True,"Yes, shoulder synovitis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, synovitis is a common feature due to the chronic autoimmune inflammatory process affecting the synovial joints. Shoulder synovitis can present as joint swelling, tenderness, and inflammation in patients with RA. Therefore, if a patient has shoulder synovitis, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosing spondylitis,437082,False,"No, ankylosing spondylitis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to stiffness, pain, and eventually fusion of the spine. While both ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis are autoimmune inflammatory disorders, they affect different joints and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having ankylosing spondylitis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis, and vice versa."
Necrotizing arteritis,4270883,False,"No, necrotizing arteritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Necrotizing arteritis refers to inflammation and damage to blood vessel walls, which can occur in various conditions such as vasculitis, giant cell arteritis, and polyarteritis nodosa. While inflammation is a common feature in Rheumatoid Arthritis, necrotizing arteritis is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having necrotizing arteritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Opera glass deformity of hands,4215588,True,"Yes, the condition ""opera glass deformity of hands"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
The opera glass deformity of hands is a characteristic finding in Rheumatoid Arthritis. It refers to a deformity where the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are hyperextended, while the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are flexed, giving the appearance of holding an opera glass. This deformity is a result of chronic inflammation and destruction of the joints in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient presents with the opera glass deformity of hands, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Plantar fasciitis,4002650,False,"No

Rationale: Plantar fasciitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue that connects the heel bone to the toes. While plantar fasciitis can cause foot pain and stiffness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Plantar fasciitis is a common condition that can occur in individuals without RA, so having plantar fasciitis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Necrotizing vasculitis secondary to infection,4299561,False,"No

Rationale: Necrotizing vasculitis secondary to infection is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, necrotizing vasculitis secondary to infection is a condition involving inflammation and damage to blood vessels due to an infection. These are two distinct conditions with different underlying mechanisms and presentations. Therefore, having necrotizing vasculitis secondary to infection does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Poliomyelitis osteopathy of the hand,435055,False,"No, Poliomyelitis osteopathy of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Poliomyelitis is a viral infection that affects the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. Osteopathy of the hand refers to bone abnormalities in the hand. These conditions are not characteristic symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having Poliomyelitis osteopathy of the hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Triceps tendinitis,4002647,False,"No

Rationale: Triceps tendinitis is inflammation of the triceps tendon, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint pain and inflammation are common symptoms of RA, triceps tendinitis is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Triceps tendinitis can occur in individuals with or without RA, so having triceps tendinitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Boil of lower limb,4201258,False,"No

Rationale: A boil of the lower limb is a localized skin infection caused by bacteria, typically Staphylococcus aureus. While it is possible for a person with rheumatoid arthritis to develop a boil on their lower limb, having a boil of the lower limb is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Boils are common skin infections that can occur in individuals with various underlying health conditions or even in healthy individuals. Therefore, the presence of a boil of the lower limb does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Periostitis of lower leg,435049,False,"No

Rationale: Periostitis of the lower leg is inflammation of the periosteum, which is the connective tissue covering the bones. While periostitis can be a symptom of various conditions, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. In RA, the primary symptoms involve joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, rather than inflammation of the periosteum. Therefore, having periostitis of the lower leg does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Gonococcal spondylitis,72562,False,"No, Gonococcal spondylitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gonococcal spondylitis is a rare infection of the spine caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It typically presents with back pain, fever, and neurological symptoms. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain, they have different underlying causes and require different treatment approaches."
Polyarticular chronic gout caused by lead,603006,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, polyarticular chronic gout caused by lead, is specific to gout caused by lead exposure, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to pain, swelling, and inflammation. Lead exposure can exacerbate gout symptoms. In contrast, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation and destruction, which is not directly related to lead exposure or uric acid crystal deposition. Therefore, having polyarticular chronic gout caused by lead does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Digital nerve lesion,4185023,False,"No, a digital nerve lesion is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A digital nerve lesion refers to damage or injury to a nerve in the fingers or toes, which can result in symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in the affected digit. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience nerve involvement as a complication of the disease, a digital nerve lesion can occur due to various other causes such as trauma, compression, or other medical conditions unrelated to RA. Therefore, having a digital nerve lesion does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,42535177,True,"Yes, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that involves inflammation in five or more joints within the first six months of disease onset. This condition is similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis in terms of joint involvement, symmetrical polyarthritis, and potential joint damage and deformities. Therefore, if a patient has polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, they definitely have a form of arthritis that is similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, not all patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis will have polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, as there are other subtypes and causes of RA."
Hydroxyapatite deposition disease of right shoulder,35615134,False,"No.

Rationale:
Hydroxyapatite deposition disease of the right shoulder is a condition characterized by the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in the soft tissues around the shoulder joint, leading to pain, inflammation, and limited range of motion. While this condition can cause symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Hydroxyapatite deposition disease is a separate entity with its own distinct etiology and pathophysiology. Therefore, having hydroxyapatite deposition disease of the right shoulder does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema,40483306,True,"Yes, the condition ""remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This condition is actually a subset of RA known as ""RS3PE syndrome,"" which is characterized by symmetrical synovitis (inflammation of the synovial membrane in joints), pitting edema (swelling that leaves an indentation when pressed), and a lack of rheumatoid factor in the blood (seronegative). This condition is considered a rare variant of RA and is typically associated with a good response to treatment with corticosteroids. Therefore, if a patient presents with remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of right quadriceps tendon,42535182,False,"No, tendinitis of the right quadriceps tendon is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tendinitis is inflammation of a tendon, which can occur due to overuse, injury, or other factors. While joint pain and inflammation are common symptoms in both tendinitis and Rheumatoid Arthritis, tendinitis is a localized condition affecting the tendon, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having tendinitis of the right quadriceps tendon does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral gouty arthritis of knees,42539266,False,"No.

Rationale:
Bilateral gouty arthritis of knees is a specific condition that refers to the presence of gouty arthritis in both knees. Gouty arthritis is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to inflammation and pain. While gouty arthritis can affect multiple joints, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a distinct autoimmune disorder characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which is not typically associated with gouty arthritis. Therefore, the presence of bilateral gouty arthritis of knees does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Myasthenia gravis,76685,False,"No, myasthenia gravis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly in the muscles that control eye movements, facial expressions, chewing, swallowing, and speaking. It is caused by antibodies attacking acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. While both rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis are autoimmune disorders, they affect different systems in the body and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having myasthenia gravis does not necessarily mean that a person also has rheumatoid arthritis."
Juvenile osteochondrosis of hand,4150193,False,"No, juvenile osteochondrosis of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile osteochondrosis is a condition that affects the growth centers in children and adolescents, leading to pain and dysfunction in the affected area. It is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and dysfunction, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms."
Juvenile arthritis in Crohn disease,4115377,False,"No.

Rationale:
Juvenile arthritis and Crohn's disease are separate medical conditions that can occur independently of each other. While there is a known association between inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease) and certain types of arthritis, such as ankylosing spondylitis, they are not specific to each other. Therefore, having juvenile arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Crohn's disease, and vice versa. Additional diagnostic tests and evaluations would be needed to confirm the presence of Crohn's disease in a patient with juvenile arthritis."
Arthritis of left midtarsal joint,42539289,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of left midtarsal joint"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by joint involvement, including small joints like those in the feet. The presence of arthritis in the midtarsal joint of the left foot would be consistent with the joint involvement seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, the chronic autoimmune inflammatory nature of RA can lead to arthritis in various joints throughout the body, including the midtarsal joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the left midtarsal joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Baboon syndrome,4080559,False,"No

Rationale: Baboon syndrome, also known as symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), is a specific type of allergic contact dermatitis characterized by a symmetrical rash in the intertriginous areas of the body (e.g., groin, axillae) following exposure to a triggering agent. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a skin condition rather than a joint-related autoimmune disorder. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop Baboon syndrome as a separate issue, having Baboon syndrome does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovitis/tenosynovitis - hand,443284,True,"Yes, synovitis/tenosynovitis in the hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, which is a hallmark feature of RA. Tenosynovitis is inflammation of the tendon sheath, which can also occur in RA due to the inflammatory process affecting the surrounding structures in the hand. Therefore, if a patient presents with synovitis/tenosynovitis in the hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause."
Arthropathy of the ankle AND/OR foot associated with a neurological disorder,4326356,True,"Yes, the condition of arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot associated with a neurological disorder is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is known to affect the synovial joints, including those in the ankle and foot. Additionally, neurological disorders can be associated with RA, leading to conditions such as arthropathy. Therefore, if a patient presents with arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot associated with a neurological disorder, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Recurrent rheumatic heart disease,4062117,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Recurrent rheumatic heart disease, on the other hand, is a complication of acute rheumatic fever, which is caused by an untreated streptococcal infection. While both conditions are related to autoimmune processes, they affect different parts of the body and have distinct clinical presentations. Therefore, having recurrent rheumatic heart disease does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral chronic rupture of anterior cruciate ligament of knees,35615110,False,"No, the condition of bilateral chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knees is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not specifically cause chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knees. This condition is more commonly associated with trauma or repetitive stress on the knees rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral osteoarthritis of midtarsal joints of feet,35615108,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral osteoarthritis of midtarsal joints of feet is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. The presence of bilateral osteoarthritis in the midtarsal joints of the feet suggests joint involvement, which is a key clinical criteria for diagnosing RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are also characteristic features of osteoarthritis. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral osteoarthritis of the midtarsal joints of the feet, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Streptococcal arthritis,4201438,False,"No, Streptococcal arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Streptococcal arthritis is a type of infectious arthritis caused by a bacterial infection with Streptococcus bacteria. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can present with joint pain and swelling, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Therefore, having Streptococcal arthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right hand caused by bacteria,42539287,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis caused by bacteria in the right hand would be considered septic arthritis. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and treatment approaches. Therefore, having arthritis of the right hand caused by bacteria does not necessarily mean that the individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of the hand associated with helminthiasis,80801,False,"No

Rationale: Arthropathy of the hand associated with helminthiasis is a condition where joint pain and inflammation in the hands are linked to a parasitic infection. While joint pain and inflammation can be symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, the specific association with helminthiasis makes this condition distinct from RA. Therefore, having arthropathy of the hand associated with helminthiasis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of left lower leg,601001,False,"No

Rationale: A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the left lower leg is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, a foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance in the soft tissue. These are two distinct conditions with different etiologies and presentations."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of left forearm,601000,False,"No

Rationale: A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the left forearm is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance in the body, such as a splinter or implant material. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with foreign body granulomas in the soft tissue of the forearm. Therefore, having a foreign body granuloma in the left forearm does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of left upper arm,601003,False,"No.

Rationale:
A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the left upper arm is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance that has been implanted in the body. In this case, it is in the soft tissue of the left upper arm. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While RA can present with joint swelling and inflammation, a foreign body granuloma is a separate entity caused by a different mechanism. Therefore, having a foreign body granuloma of the soft tissue of the left upper arm does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of left thigh,601002,False,"No

Rationale:
A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the left thigh is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance, such as a splinter or surgical material, that the body is unable to eliminate. It is not a characteristic symptom or diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having a foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the left thigh does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Parana hard skin syndrome,37204372,False,"No, Parana hard skin syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Parana hard skin syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It is not associated with the autoimmune inflammatory joint symptoms seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having Parana hard skin syndrome does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of right forearm,601005,False,"No

Rationale: A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the right forearm is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign body, such as a splinter or implant, that can cause swelling, pain, and tissue damage. This condition is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis, as it is a separate and distinct issue related to the presence of a foreign body in the soft tissue. While a patient with rheumatoid arthritis may potentially develop a foreign body granuloma due to their compromised immune system, the presence of a foreign body granuloma does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of right ankle,601004,False,"No, the condition ""Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of right ankle"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance, such as a splinter or implant material, that the body is unable to eliminate. It is not a characteristic symptom or diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints with symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. Therefore, having a foreign body granuloma in the soft tissue of the right ankle does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of right thigh,601007,False,"No

Rationale: A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the right thigh is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance in the body, such as a splinter or surgical material. It is not a characteristic symptom or sign of Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having a foreign body granuloma in the soft tissue of the right thigh does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Climacteric arthritis of multiple sites,80806,True,"Yes, climacteric arthritis of multiple sites is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Climacteric arthritis refers to arthritis that occurs during the climacteric period, which is the transitional phase in a person's life when reproductive function declines. In the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the term ""climacteric arthritis of multiple sites"" likely refers to the characteristic joint involvement seen in RA, where multiple joints are affected symmetrically. This aligns with the description of RA as a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction.

Therefore, if a person has climacteric arthritis of multiple sites, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of right lower leg,601006,False,"No

Rationale: A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the right lower leg is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance in the tissue, which is not a characteristic feature of RA. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with foreign body granulomas in the soft tissue of the lower leg. Therefore, having a foreign body granuloma of the soft tissue of the right lower leg does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic rupture of lateral collateral ligament of left knee,35609016,False,"No, chronic rupture of the lateral collateral ligament of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition mentioned, chronic rupture of the lateral collateral ligament of the left knee, is a specific injury to the ligament in the knee joint and is not a characteristic symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling, the specific condition of a chronic rupture of the lateral collateral ligament is not directly related to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic rupture of lateral collateral ligament of right knee,35609015,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic rupture of the lateral collateral ligament of the right knee is a specific condition related to a knee injury, and it is not a characteristic symptom or sign of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint pain and swelling are common symptoms of RA, they are not typically caused by a specific ligament rupture in the knee. Therefore, having a chronic rupture of the lateral collateral ligament of the right knee does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of skeletal muscle,72618,False,"No, a disorder of skeletal muscle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, it is not specifically associated with skeletal muscle disorders. Skeletal muscle disorders may present with symptoms such as muscle weakness, pain, and atrophy, which are not typical features of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having a disorder of skeletal muscle does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of cardiovascular system,134057,False,"No, a disorder of the cardiovascular system is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While cardiovascular complications can occur in patients with RA due to chronic inflammation and increased risk of atherosclerosis, having a disorder of the cardiovascular system does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other factors and diagnostic criteria specific to RA when assessing for this condition."
Flexion deformity of joint of right knee,600997,True,"Yes, a flexion deformity of the joint of the right knee can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint deformities are common due to the chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints. Flexion deformities, where the joint is stuck in a bent position, can occur as a result of joint damage and erosion in RA. Therefore, if a patient presents with a flexion deformity of the joint of the right knee, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of left ankle,600999,False,"No

Rationale: A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the left ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance, such as a splinter or implant material, and is not a characteristic feature of RA. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with foreign body granulomas in the soft tissue. Therefore, having a foreign body granuloma of the soft tissue of the left ankle does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia,441269,True,"Yes, autoimmune hemolytic anemia can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys red blood cells, leading to anemia. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, autoimmune processes are already at play, as it is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder. It is possible for the autoimmune response in Rheumatoid Arthritis to also target red blood cells, leading to autoimmune hemolytic anemia as a complication of the disease. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops autoimmune hemolytic anemia, it is likely specific to their underlying condition."
Pyogenic arthritis of ankle,4068237,False,"No

Rationale:
Pyogenic arthritis of the ankle is a specific condition involving a bacterial infection of the ankle joint, leading to inflammation, pain, and swelling. While it shares some symptoms with rheumatoid arthritis, such as joint pain and swelling, the underlying cause is different. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, whereas pyogenic arthritis is caused by a bacterial infection. Therefore, having pyogenic arthritis of the ankle does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Adhesion of tendon of hand,4144010,False,"No

Rationale: Adhesion of tendon of hand is a condition that involves the abnormal adherence of tendons in the hand, which can lead to restricted movement and pain. While this condition can occur in individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to inflammation and joint damage, it is not specific to RA. Adhesion of tendon of hand can also occur in other conditions such as trauma, overuse injuries, and infections. Therefore, having adhesion of tendon of hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of lower extremity,193460,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of lower extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it can also affect other parts of the body, including the lower extremities. However, a disorder of the lower extremity could be caused by a variety of other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, or even injuries unrelated to RA. Therefore, having a disorder of the lower extremity does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Flexion deformity of finger,4068232,True,"Yes, a flexion deformity of the finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction can lead to deformities and functional impairment, including flexion deformities of the fingers. This deformity is a common manifestation of RA due to the chronic inflammation and joint damage characteristic of the disease. Therefore, if a patient presents with a flexion deformity of the finger, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of shoulder region,4180873,False,"No, infective arthritis of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is a bacterial infection of a joint that can affect any joint in the body, including the shoulder. It is characterized by joint pain, swelling, redness, and limited range of motion. The presence of infective arthritis of the shoulder region does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a separate condition caused by a bacterial infection rather than an autoimmune disorder like RA."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of right upper arm,601008,False,"No

Rationale: A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the right upper arm is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance in the tissue, which is not a characteristic feature of RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While RA can present with extra-articular manifestations, a foreign body granuloma is not a typical finding in RA."
Hydroxyapatite deposition disease of joint of foot,607177,True,"Yes, the condition of Hydroxyapatite deposition disease of the joint of the foot is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Hydroxyapatite deposition disease is a condition where calcium deposits form in the joints, causing pain and inflammation. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction are common symptoms, which can lead to calcium deposits forming in the affected joints, including the foot. Therefore, if a patient has Hydroxyapatite deposition disease of the joint of the foot, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hydroxyapatite deposition disease of joint of ankle,607179,True,"Yes, the condition of Hydroxyapatite deposition disease of the joint of the ankle is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Hydroxyapatite deposition disease is a condition where calcium deposits form in the joints, leading to pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. While this condition can occur in various joints, including the ankle, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

On the other hand, Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient has Hydroxyapatite deposition disease of the joint of the ankle, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis as it can affect the joints in a similar manner."
Osteochondritis of the talus,4301698,False,"No, osteochondritis of the talus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteochondritis of the talus is a condition characterized by the death of a segment of bone in the ankle joint due to a lack of blood supply. It typically presents with ankle pain, swelling, and difficulty bearing weight on the affected ankle. While it can be associated with inflammatory conditions like RA, it is not a defining feature of RA. Therefore, having osteochondritis of the talus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective myositis of forearm,4002809,False,"No

Rationale: Infective myositis of the forearm is a condition involving inflammation of the muscles in the forearm due to infection. While this condition may cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and tenderness in the affected area, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having infective myositis of the forearm does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Infective myositis of shoulder,4002808,False,"No

Rationale:
Infective myositis of the shoulder is a condition involving inflammation of the muscles in the shoulder due to infection. While this condition may cause symptoms such as shoulder pain and swelling, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are not typically associated with infective myositis. Therefore, having infective myositis of the shoulder does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Left shoulder region pneumococcal arthritis,601027,True,"Yes, the condition of left shoulder region pneumococcal arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition of left shoulder region pneumococcal arthritis specifically involves the left shoulder joint, which is a type of synovial joint. Additionally, pneumococcal arthritis is a type of infectious arthritis caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can trigger an autoimmune response leading to conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has left shoulder region pneumococcal arthritis, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Left hip joint arthritis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,601026,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints, whereas the condition specified is a specific type of arthritis caused by a bacterial infection (Streptococcus pneumoniae). While both conditions involve joint inflammation, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Therefore, having left hip joint arthritis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Right shoulder region pneumococcal arthritis,601029,False,"No

Rationale: Pneumococcal arthritis is a type of infectious arthritis caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is an infection rather than an autoimmune disorder. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop infectious arthritis, the presence of pneumococcal arthritis in the right shoulder region does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Right hip joint arthritis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,601028,False,"No, the condition of right hip joint arthritis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas the condition described is a specific type of arthritis caused by a bacterial infection (Streptococcus pneumoniae). The etiology and pathophysiology of these two conditions are different, making them distinct entities. Additionally, the presence of a bacterial infection as the cause of arthritis in the condition provided is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deformity of phalanx of finger or thumb,4154352,True,"Yes, deformity of phalanx of finger or thumb can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction can lead to deformities in the fingers and thumbs, such as swan neck deformity, boutonniere deformity, and ulnar deviation. These deformities are characteristic of RA and can be a key clinical feature in diagnosing the disease. Therefore, if a patient presents with deformity of the phalanx of the finger or thumb, it may strongly suggest the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pediatric onset Sjögren syndrome,42539352,False,"No

Rationale: Pediatric onset Sjögren syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Sjögren syndrome is a separate autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth due to lymphocytic infiltration of the lacrimal and salivary glands. While both conditions are autoimmune disorders, they affect different parts of the body and have distinct diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having pediatric onset Sjögren syndrome does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Transient synovitis of left hand,601053,False,"No

Rationale: Transient synovitis of the left hand is a temporary inflammation of the synovial membrane in the hand joint, often caused by an infection or injury. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a temporary and localized issue rather than a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting multiple joints. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can present with joint swelling and tenderness, the presence of transient synovitis of the left hand alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Transient synovitis of left elbow,601052,False,"No

Rationale: Transient synovitis of the left elbow is a self-limiting condition characterized by inflammation of the synovial lining of the elbow joint, often seen in children. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a temporary condition that does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA. RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings required for diagnosis. Therefore, having transient synovitis of the left elbow does not definitively mean that an individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Transient synovitis of left wrist,601055,False,"No

Rationale:
Transient synovitis of the left wrist is a self-limiting condition characterized by inflammation of the synovial lining of the wrist joint, often following a viral infection or minor trauma. It is typically seen in children and adolescents and resolves on its own without long-term consequences. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a temporary and localized issue in the wrist joint, whereas RA is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting multiple joints symmetrically. While RA can affect the wrist joint, transient synovitis of the left wrist is not a definitive indicator of RA."
Chronic crepitant synovitis of wrist,4287383,True,"Yes, chronic crepitant synovitis of the wrist is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: Chronic crepitant synovitis of the wrist is a specific symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a manifestation of the chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints that is characteristic of RA. This symptom, along with the chronic nature of the condition, is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Transient synovitis of left hip,601054,False,"No

Rationale: Transient synovitis of the left hip is a self-limiting condition that primarily affects children and is characterized by inflammation of the synovial lining of the hip joint. It is typically a benign condition that resolves on its own without long-term consequences. While joint inflammation is a common feature of both transient synovitis and rheumatoid arthritis, transient synovitis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having transient synovitis of the left hip does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Autoimmune ganglionopathy,3654638,False,"No

Rationale:
Autoimmune ganglionopathy is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system, specifically the ganglia. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it involves a different part of the body (nervous system) and does not directly affect the synovial joints as seen in RA. While autoimmune conditions can coexist, having autoimmune ganglionopathy does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Subcutaneous lipochagoma,4080615,False,"No, subcutaneous lipochagoma is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Subcutaneous lipochagoma is a benign tumor composed of mature adipose tissue and fibrous septa. It is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have subcutaneous lipochagoma, the presence of subcutaneous lipochagoma does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Extensor digitorum longus tenosynovitis,4002791,False,"No, extensor digitorum longus tenosynovitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Extensor digitorum longus tenosynovitis is a condition involving inflammation of the tendon sheath of the extensor digitorum longus muscle in the leg, typically causing pain and swelling. While it can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the systemic nature of the disease affecting multiple joints and tendons, it is not a defining characteristic of RA. Extensor digitorum longus tenosynovitis can also occur in other conditions or as a result of overuse or injury. Therefore, having extensor digitorum longus tenosynovitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankle joint finding,443357,False,"No

Rationale: An ankle joint finding alone is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including the ankles, an ankle joint finding could be present in various other conditions such as ankle sprains, fractures, osteoarthritis, gout, or even other autoimmune diseases. Therefore, having an ankle joint finding does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Peroneal tendinitis of right lower limb,36717035,False,"No, peroneal tendinitis of the right lower limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Peroneal tendinitis is a condition involving inflammation of the peroneal tendons, which are located on the outer side of the lower leg and foot. While it can cause pain and swelling in the affected area, it is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having peroneal tendinitis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of left knee joint,36717036,False,"No, osteoarthritis of the left knee joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While both osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis are types of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Osteoarthritis is primarily due to wear and tear on the joints, while Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left knee joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of finger of hand,36684274,True,"Yes, a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the finger of the hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis can present with subcutaneous nodules, which are firm, non-tender lumps that develop under the skin, typically over bony prominences or areas subject to pressure. These nodules are commonly found in the fingers, hands, elbows, and feet of patients with RA. Therefore, if a patient has a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the finger of the hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune optic neuropathy,3654632,False,"No

Rationale: Autoimmune optic neuropathy is a condition affecting the optic nerve, leading to vision loss or impairment. While autoimmune conditions can coexist with rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune optic neuropathy is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. It is possible to have autoimmune optic neuropathy without having rheumatoid arthritis, so the presence of autoimmune optic neuropathy does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of upper limb,36684272,False,"No, a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the upper limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition and can be present in other diseases such as gout or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the upper limb does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle and/or foot,74720,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle and/or foot"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Behcet's syndrome is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disorder that can affect various parts of the body, including the joints. Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome can present with symptoms similar to those seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis, such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the ankle and/or foot, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, having Rheumatoid Arthritis does not necessarily mean that a patient will have Behcet's syndrome."
Knuckle pads,4041695,True,"Yes, knuckle pads can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Knuckle pads, also known as Garrod's pads, are thickened areas of skin that develop over the knuckles. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, knuckle pads can be a manifestation of the disease, particularly in the hands where joint swelling and deformities are common. Therefore, if a patient presents with knuckle pads, it may suggest the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Atrophic condition of skin,134118,False,"No, an atrophic condition of the skin is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Atrophic skin changes, such as thinning, wrinkling, and loss of elasticity, can be seen in a variety of conditions, including aging, sun damage, hormonal changes, and certain skin disorders. While RA can have skin manifestations such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, and skin ulcers, atrophic skin changes are not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having an atrophic condition of the skin does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Alveolar pneumopathy,4252581,False,"No, alveolar pneumopathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Alveolar pneumopathy refers to a condition affecting the alveoli in the lungs, which is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While respiratory complications can occur in RA, alveolar pneumopathy is not a defining feature of the disease."
Transient arthropathy of the shoulder region,74727,False,"No

Rationale: Transient arthropathy of the shoulder region is a non-specific condition that refers to temporary joint pain and inflammation in the shoulder area. While it may be a symptom of various conditions, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly in the hands and feet, and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, the presence of transient arthropathy of the shoulder region does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Pneumoconiosis,259044,False,"No

Rationale: Pneumoconiosis is a group of lung diseases caused by the inhalation of dust particles, typically in an occupational setting. It is not directly related to Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the joints. While some autoimmune diseases may have lung involvement, pneumoconiosis is not a specific condition associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Transient synovitis of right hand,601057,False,"No

Rationale: Transient synovitis of the right hand is a temporary inflammation of the synovial membrane in the hand joint, often caused by an infection or injury. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a temporary and localized issue in the hand joint, whereas RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting multiple joints symmetrically. While RA can affect the hands, it is not limited to transient inflammation and is characterized by specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings as described in the malady description."
Transient synovitis of right elbow,601056,False,"No.

Rationale:
Transient synovitis of the right elbow is a self-limiting condition characterized by inflammation of the synovial lining of the elbow joint, typically seen in children. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a temporary condition that does not necessarily indicate the presence of an autoimmune disorder like RA. While joint inflammation is a common feature in both conditions, the underlying causes and long-term implications are different. Therefore, having transient synovitis of the right elbow does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Transient synovitis of right wrist,601059,False,"No

Rationale: Transient synovitis of the right wrist is a temporary inflammation of the synovial lining of the wrist joint, often seen in children. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a self-limiting condition that does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA. RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and the symptoms and diagnostic criteria for RA are more extensive and specific than those of transient synovitis."
Transient synovitis of right hip,601058,False,"No

Rationale: Transient synovitis of the right hip is a self-limiting condition that primarily affects the hip joint, causing pain and limited range of motion. It is commonly seen in children and is often triggered by a viral infection. While it can cause joint swelling and tenderness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints, with characteristic features such as symmetric polyarthritis, joint destruction, and systemic involvement. Therefore, having transient synovitis of the right hip does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Recurrent dislocation of ankle AND/OR foot,76783,False,"No

Rationale: Recurrent dislocation of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint deformities and functional impairment can occur in RA, recurrent dislocation of the ankle and/or foot is not a defining characteristic of the disease. This condition could be caused by other factors such as ligament laxity, trauma, or other underlying joint disorders. Therefore, having recurrent dislocation of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Complication,433128,False,"No, the condition ""Complication"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Complications can arise from various medical conditions, including RA, but they are not exclusive to RA. Complications can occur in many different diseases and conditions, so having a complication does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rupture of anterior cruciate ligament of left knee,760825,False,"No

Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may experience joint pain and swelling, a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament is a specific injury to the knee ligament and is not a defining characteristic of RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by autoimmune inflammation, joint destruction, and deformities, rather than acute injuries to specific ligaments."
Derangement of knee,76786,False,"No, a derangement of the knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a key feature of RA, a derangement of the knee can be caused by a variety of conditions such as ligament injuries, meniscal tears, or osteoarthritis. Therefore, having a derangement of the knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rupture of anterior cruciate ligament of right knee,760824,False,"No

Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of RA, a specific injury like a ligament rupture is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Additionally, a ligament rupture is a physical injury rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA. Therefore, having a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the right knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune vasculitis,4146124,False,"No, autoimmune vasculitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Autoimmune vasculitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of blood vessels due to the immune system attacking them. While autoimmune vasculitis can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not exclusive to this malady. Autoimmune vasculitis can also be associated with other autoimmune diseases or occur on its own. Therefore, having autoimmune vasculitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Exacerbation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis,1340385,True,"Yes, an exacerbation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects children and adolescents. It shares similarities with Rheumatoid Arthritis in terms of joint inflammation and destruction. An exacerbation of JIA would indicate a worsening of the symptoms associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which are similar to those seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if someone is experiencing an exacerbation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, it is likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Wrist joint inflamed,4185031,True,"Yes, the condition ""Wrist joint inflamed"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint inflammation is a hallmark feature, and the wrist joint is commonly affected in this condition. The presence of wrist joint inflammation is a key clinical sign that aligns with the diagnostic criteria for RA, which includes joint involvement with swelling and tenderness. Additionally, the symmetric polyarthritis seen in RA often affects the small joints of the hands and feet, including the wrist joint. Therefore, if a patient presents with an inflamed wrist joint, it strongly suggests the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Anemia of chronic disease,437247,True,"Yes, anemia of chronic disease is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Anemia of chronic disease is a common complication of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, chronic inflammation can lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines that affect the production and lifespan of red blood cells, leading to anemia. Therefore, if a patient has anemia of chronic disease, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, not all patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis will necessarily develop anemia of chronic disease, as it can also occur in other chronic inflammatory conditions."
Acute tear of meniscus of left knee,760823,False,"No, an acute tear of the meniscus of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. An acute tear of the meniscus is a common injury that can occur due to trauma or degenerative changes in the knee joint, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop secondary issues such as meniscal tears due to joint inflammation and instability, the presence of an acute tear of the meniscus does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pyogenic bacterial arthritis of elbow,764919,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the elbow is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic bacterial arthritis is an infection of the joint caused by bacteria, leading to joint inflammation, pain, and swelling. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, the immune system is already compromised, making them more susceptible to infections such as pyogenic bacterial arthritis. Additionally, the symptoms of pyogenic bacterial arthritis, such as joint pain and swelling, can be mistaken for a flare-up of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the elbow, it is a specific condition associated with their underlying malady."
Traumatic arthropathy of the shoulder region,72708,False,"No

Rationale: Traumatic arthropathy of the shoulder region is a condition that results from trauma or injury to the shoulder joint, leading to degenerative changes in the joint. While traumatic arthropathy can cause symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Traumatic arthropathy is a separate condition caused by physical injury, whereas RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Therefore, having traumatic arthropathy of the shoulder region does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Villous arthropathy of multiple joints,764931,True,"Yes, the condition of villous arthropathy of multiple joints is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Villous arthropathy refers to the presence of synovial villi in the joints, which is a characteristic finding in Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the chronic inflammatory process affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, if a patient has villous arthropathy of multiple joints, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of palmar fascia,136203,True,"Yes, contracture of palmar fascia is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Contracture of palmar fascia, also known as Dupuytren's contracture, is a common manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is characterized by the thickening and tightening of the palmar fascia, leading to the formation of nodules and cords in the palm and fingers. While Dupuytren's contracture can also occur in other conditions or as an isolated entity, it is more commonly associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient presents with contracture of palmar fascia, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Spondylosis due to another disorder,764930,False,"No

Rationale: Spondylosis due to another disorder is a condition that refers to degenerative changes in the spine caused by another underlying condition, such as osteoarthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. While spondylosis can cause joint pain and stiffness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having spondylosis due to another disorder does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Chest deformity due to ankylosing spondylitis,3654715,False,"No, the condition of chest deformity due to ankylosing spondylitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to fusion and stiffness. While ankylosing spondylitis can cause chest deformities due to the involvement of the spine and rib cage, this specific condition is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having a chest deformity due to ankylosing spondylitis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammatory disorder of musculoskeletal system,4176946,True,"Yes, the condition ""Inflammatory disorder of musculoskeletal system"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, which are part of the musculoskeletal system. The condition described aligns with the symptoms and characteristics of Rheumatoid Arthritis, making it specific to this malady."
Flexion deformity of joint of left knee,609287,True,"Yes, a flexion deformity of the joint of the left knee can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint deformities are common due to the chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints. Flexion deformities, where the joint is stuck in a bent position, can occur as a result of joint damage and erosion in RA. Therefore, if a patient has a flexion deformity of the joint of the left knee, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Fistula of joint of shoulder,764932,False,"No, a fistula of the joint of the shoulder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A fistula is an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as between an organ and the skin. In the context of the shoulder joint, a fistula could be caused by various conditions such as infection, trauma, or inflammatory arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint destruction, the presence of a fistula in the shoulder joint does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and diagnostic criteria specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis would be needed to confirm the presence of this condition."
Overriding fingers,4209752,False,"No, overriding fingers are not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Overriding fingers can be caused by a variety of conditions such as trauma, congenital abnormalities, or other types of arthritis. While it is possible for Rheumatoid Arthritis to cause joint deformities leading to overriding fingers, it is not a definitive indicator of the disease as there are other potential causes for this condition."
Elbow pyogenic arthritis,4346971,True,"Yes, elbow pyogenic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Pyogenic arthritis is an infection of the joint space caused by bacteria, leading to joint inflammation, pain, and swelling. In the case of elbow pyogenic arthritis, the infection specifically affects the elbow joint. 

In the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, patients with RA are at an increased risk of developing infections, including pyogenic arthritis, due to the immunosuppressive effects of the disease and the use of immunosuppressive medications. Therefore, if a patient with RA develops elbow pyogenic arthritis, it is likely a complication of their underlying RA. 

Additionally, the symptoms of elbow pyogenic arthritis, such as joint pain, swelling, and inflammation, can overlap with the symptoms of RA, making it difficult to differentiate between the two conditions based on symptoms alone. Therefore, the presence of elbow pyogenic arthritis in a patient with RA would likely be attributed to their underlying RA."
Joint injury,4054054,False,"No, joint injury is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Joint injury can occur due to various reasons such as trauma, overuse, or accidents, and it does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA. While joint injury can potentially lead to inflammation and pain in the affected joint, it is not a definitive indicator of RA. RA is an autoimmune disease with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings that need to be considered for a diagnosis. Therefore, having a joint injury does not mean that a person definitely has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Malignant neoplasm of connective and soft tissue of finger,4095010,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Malignant neoplasm of connective and soft tissue of finger"" refers to a type of cancer affecting the soft tissues of the finger. While rheumatoid arthritis can cause joint deformities and damage in the fingers, it is not directly related to the development of malignant neoplasms. Therefore, having a malignant neoplasm of connective and soft tissue of the finger does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the spine,4176931,True,"Yes, arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the spine is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Behcet's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis that can affect multiple organ systems, including the musculoskeletal system. Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome can involve the spine and present with symptoms similar to those seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis, such as joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. However, the key difference is that Behcet's syndrome is not primarily an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints like Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the spine, they may have symptoms similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis, but the underlying cause is different."
Lumbar spondylosis,4346975,False,"No, lumbar spondylosis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Lumbar spondylosis is a degenerative condition affecting the spine, specifically the lumbar region. It is characterized by degeneration of the intervertebral discs and the formation of bone spurs in the spine. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, lumbar spondylosis affects the spinal discs and vertebrae. While a patient with RA may also have lumbar spondylosis, having lumbar spondylosis does not necessarily mean that the patient has RA."
Early onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis,4035612,True,"Yes, the condition of early onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and early onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that presents with similar symptoms of symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Additionally, both conditions involve multiple joints being affected, which is a key characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a person has early onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis,4297824,True,"Yes, necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis is a rare but recognized cutaneous manifestation of RA. It presents as painful, ulcerative skin lesions due to inflammation and damage to blood vessels in the skin. While not all patients with RA will develop necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis, if a patient does have this condition, it is highly suggestive of an underlying diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, the presence of necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Lumbar arthritis,44783242,False,"No, lumbar arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Lumbar arthritis refers to arthritis affecting the lumbar spine, specifically the joints between the vertebrae. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints in the hands and feet, it can also affect other joints in the body, including the spine. However, lumbar arthritis can be caused by various types of arthritis, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having lumbar arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosing spondylitis with organ / system involvement,4035614,True,"Yes, ankylosing spondylitis with organ/system involvement is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to fusion and stiffness. While ankylosing spondylitis and Rheumatoid Arthritis are both autoimmune inflammatory disorders, they affect different joints and have different diagnostic criteria. Ankylosing spondylitis typically does not involve the small joints of the hands and feet as seen in RA. Additionally, organ/system involvement is not a typical feature of RA but can be seen in ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosing spondylitis with organ/system involvement, they do not definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Polymyositis associated with autoimmune disease,4346977,True,"Yes, the condition of Polymyositis associated with autoimmune disease is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Polymyositis is an autoimmune inflammatory myopathy that primarily affects the skeletal muscles, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. It is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, including Rheumatoid Arthritis. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, the immune system attacks the synovial joints, leading to joint inflammation and destruction. The presence of Polymyositis in a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis suggests a more severe autoimmune process affecting both the muscles and joints. Therefore, if a patient has Polymyositis associated with autoimmune disease, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Localized, primary osteoarthritis of elbow",4197477,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, localized, primary osteoarthritis of the elbow, is specific to osteoarthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis. While both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are types of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Osteoarthritis is primarily a degenerative joint disease, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Therefore, having localized, primary osteoarthritis of the elbow does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Sclerodactyly,4308071,True,"Yes, sclerodactyly is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Sclerodactyly is a condition characterized by thickening and tightening of the skin on the fingers and toes, which can be a manifestation of advanced Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is a common finding in patients with RA and is often associated with other symptoms of the disease such as joint deformities and swelling. Therefore, if a patient presents with sclerodactyly, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finger ulcer,4205676,True,"Yes, a finger ulcer can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In patients with RA, chronic inflammation can lead to the development of ulcers on the fingers due to impaired blood flow and tissue damage. These ulcers are often painful and can be difficult to heal. Therefore, if a patient presents with a finger ulcer, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis as a potential underlying cause."
Granuloma inguinale,199726,False,"No, granuloma inguinale is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Granuloma inguinale is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Klebsiella granulomatis, which primarily affects the genital and perianal regions. It presents as painless, beefy red ulcers with a granular base. The two conditions are unrelated in terms of etiology, symptoms, and presentation."
Lateral epicondylitis of right humerus,37109275,False,"No, lateral epicondylitis of the right humerus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, is a condition characterized by pain and inflammation on the outer part of the elbow. It is typically caused by overuse of the forearm muscles and tendons. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop lateral epicondylitis as a secondary condition due to joint inflammation and stress on the tendons, having lateral epicondylitis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic axillary lymphadenitis,37312009,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic axillary lymphadenitis is a condition characterized by the chronic inflammation of the lymph nodes in the armpit area. While it can be a symptom of various underlying conditions such as infections or malignancies, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having chronic axillary lymphadenitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Left hand horseshoe tenosynovitis,3175428,True,"Yes, left hand horseshoe tenosynovitis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Horseshoe tenosynovitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the tendons and their sheaths in the hand. In the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, tenosynovitis is a common manifestation, particularly affecting the small joints of the hands. The presence of tenosynovitis in the left hand, in this case, is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis as it is a common feature of the disease, especially in the early stages. Additionally, the symmetric polyarthritis seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis often involves multiple joints, including those in the hands. Therefore, the presence of left hand horseshoe tenosynovitis would strongly suggest the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Carbuncle of lower limb,4199541,False,"No

Rationale: A carbuncle of the lower limb is a localized skin infection involving a group of hair follicles and surrounding tissue. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a skin infection and not a symptom or sign of RA. While a person with RA may develop a carbuncle due to their compromised immune system, having a carbuncle of the lower limb does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hand rheumatism,4002820,True,"Yes, hand rheumatism is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hand rheumatism refers to inflammation and pain in the joints of the hands, which is a common symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, the small joints of the hands are often affected, leading to swelling, tenderness, and deformities. Therefore, if someone has hand rheumatism, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Sequelae of inflammatory diseases,4178949,False,"No, the condition ""Sequelae of inflammatory diseases"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. The term ""sequelae"" refers to the aftereffects or consequences of a previous disease or injury. Inflammatory diseases can have a wide range of sequelae, and they are not exclusive to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having sequelae of inflammatory diseases does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hemarthrosis of right knee,37109261,True,"Yes, hemarthrosis of the right knee can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hemarthrosis, which is bleeding into a joint, can occur in patients with RA due to inflammation and damage to the synovial lining of the joint. In RA, the chronic inflammation can lead to joint swelling, pain, and ultimately hemarthrosis. Therefore, if a patient presents with hemarthrosis of the right knee, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
CREST syndrome,4135937,False,"No, CREST syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. CREST syndrome, also known as limited systemic sclerosis, is a connective tissue disorder characterized by calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia. While both conditions are autoimmune disorders, they have distinct clinical features and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having CREST syndrome does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic inguinal lymphadenitis,37312007,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic inguinal lymphadenitis is a condition characterized by inflammation and enlargement of the lymph nodes in the inguinal region. While this condition may be seen in various infectious and inflammatory conditions, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. In rheumatoid arthritis, the primary manifestations are joint-related symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, rather than lymph node inflammation. Therefore, having chronic inguinal lymphadenitis does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Acute osteomyelitis of knee,4121601,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute osteomyelitis of the knee is a bacterial infection of the bone, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop osteomyelitis as a complication, having acute osteomyelitis of the knee does not definitively mean that the patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis. The two conditions are distinct entities with different etiologies and diagnostic criteria."
Enterobacterial spondylitis,4068478,False,"No, Enterobacterial spondylitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Enterobacterial spondylitis refers to an infection of the spine caused by Enterobacteriaceae bacteria, such as E. coli or Klebsiella. This condition is not related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that characterizes Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and inflammation, they have different underlying causes and require different treatment approaches."
Epidermoid cyst of hand,4179070,False,"No.

Rationale:
An epidermoid cyst of the hand is a benign growth that arises from the epidermis and is not directly related to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have an epidermoid cyst of the hand, the presence of an epidermoid cyst of the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, the condition is not specific to the malady."
Sheepshearer's hair sinus,4033663,False,"No

Rationale:
Sheepshearer's hair sinus is a condition specific to individuals who work with sheep and develop a sinus infection due to exposure to sheep wool. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is unrelated to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having Sheepshearer's hair sinus does not necessarily mean that an individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Black palm,4033657,False,"No, black palm is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Black palm is not a recognized symptom or diagnostic criteria for RA. The characteristic symptoms of RA include joint swelling, tenderness, morning stiffness, and joint pain, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, the presence of black palm alone would not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Subungual hematoma of little finger of right hand,37310077,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma of the little finger of the right hand is a localized collection of blood under the nail, typically caused by trauma to the finger. While this condition can occur in individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Subungual hematomas can happen in individuals without RA as well, so having this condition does not definitively mean that the individual has RA."
Subungual hematoma of little finger of left hand,37310076,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma of the little finger of the left hand is a localized collection of blood underneath the nail, typically caused by trauma to the finger. While this condition may cause pain and discoloration of the nail, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and deformities. Therefore, having a subungual hematoma does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic pyrophosphate crystal arthropathy,44814062,True,"Yes, chronic pyrophosphate crystal arthropathy is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Chronic pyrophosphate crystal arthropathy, also known as pseudogout, is a condition characterized by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, leading to acute inflammatory arthritis. While chronic pyrophosphate crystal arthropathy can present with joint pain, swelling, and inflammation similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to RA. In contrast, Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient has chronic pyrophosphate crystal arthropathy, they may or may not have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of toe,4179065,False,"No

Rationale: Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gouty arthritis can affect the toe joints, it is a distinct condition from rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the toe does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Subungual hematoma of ring finger of right hand,37310079,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma of the ring finger of the right hand is a localized collection of blood underneath the nail. While this condition can be caused by trauma or injury to the finger, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Subungual hematomas are not a characteristic symptom or sign of RA. Therefore, having a subungual hematoma of the ring finger of the right hand does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Subungual hematoma of ring finger of left hand,37310078,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma of the ring finger of the left hand is a localized condition involving bleeding under the nail of the finger. While this condition can occur in individuals with various underlying health conditions, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Subungual hematomas can be caused by trauma or injury to the finger, such as crushing or slamming the finger in a door. Therefore, the presence of a subungual hematoma of the ring finger of the left hand does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Calcinosis in fingers,4093043,True,"Yes, calcinosis in fingers can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Calcinosis is the formation of calcium deposits in the soft tissues, which can occur in patients with RA as a result of chronic inflammation and joint damage. In RA, calcinosis can manifest as nodules or lumps in the fingers, which can be a specific sign of the disease. Therefore, if a patient has calcinosis in their fingers, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Strain of rotator cuff of shoulder,37312105,False,"No

Rationale:
A strain of the rotator cuff of the shoulder is a musculoskeletal injury that can occur due to overuse, trauma, or improper lifting. While it can cause shoulder pain and limited range of motion, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having a strain of the rotator cuff of the shoulder does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Dactylitis,4131942,True,"Yes, dactylitis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Dactylitis, also known as ""sausage digit,"" is a condition characterized by inflammation and swelling of an entire digit, such as a finger or toe. It is commonly seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, particularly in the early stages of the disease. Dactylitis is considered a specific sign of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is not commonly seen in other types of arthritis. Therefore, if a patient presents with dactylitis, it may strongly suggest the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Granuloma of buttock,40486453,False,"No

Rationale: Granuloma of the buttock is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Granulomas are small areas of inflammation in tissue, which can be caused by a variety of conditions such as infections, foreign bodies, or autoimmune diseases. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with granulomas in the buttock area. Therefore, having a granuloma of the buttock does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Closed fracture of condyle of right femur,765014,False,"No

Rationale: A closed fracture of the condyle of the right femur is a specific injury to the bone of the thigh, and it is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may be at a higher risk for fractures due to bone weakening from chronic inflammation, the presence of a closed fracture of the condyle of the right femur does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Atrophy of interosseous muscle of hand,36714094,True,"Yes, atrophy of the interosseous muscles of the hand can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, chronic inflammation in the joints can lead to muscle atrophy due to disuse, pain, and joint deformities. The interosseous muscles of the hand are commonly affected in RA, leading to weakness and atrophy. Therefore, if a patient presents with atrophy of the interosseous muscles of the hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause."
Arthritis of temporomandibular joint as part of polyarthritis,4033630,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of temporomandibular joint as part of polyarthritis"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. The involvement of the temporomandibular joint as part of polyarthritis would be consistent with the systemic nature of RA. Additionally, the presence of arthritis in the temporomandibular joint as part of polyarthritis would align with the clinical criteria for diagnosing RA, which includes joint involvement. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis of the temporomandibular joint as part of polyarthritis, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteitis of upper arm,4217894,False,"No

Rationale: Osteitis of the upper arm refers to inflammation of the bone in the upper arm, which is not a specific symptom or characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically involve inflammation of the bone itself. Therefore, having osteitis of the upper arm does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pyogenic bacterial arthritis of hand,765024,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the hand is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic bacterial arthritis is an infection of the joint caused by bacteria, leading to symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. These symptoms can be similar to those seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis, but the presence of a bacterial infection differentiates pyogenic bacterial arthritis from RA. Therefore, if a patient has pyogenic bacterial arthritis of the hand, they definitely do not have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Polyarthritis due to Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae,4254769,True,"Yes, polyarthritis due to Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Polyarthritis refers to inflammation in multiple joints, which is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a bacterium that can cause polyarthritis as a rare complication of infection. However, the specific cause of polyarthritis in this case is important to differentiate from other causes of polyarthritis, such as RA. Therefore, if a patient has polyarthritis due to Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of skin and/or subcutaneous tissue,4181062,False,"No, inflammation of the skin and/or subcutaneous tissue is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is characterized by joint inflammation, the presence of inflammation in the skin and subcutaneous tissue could be indicative of other conditions such as dermatitis, cellulitis, or other skin disorders. It is important to consider other symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and medical history to determine if the inflammation is related to RA or another underlying condition."
Reactive arthritis of spine,765044,True,"Yes, reactive arthritis of the spine is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that can affect the spine, joints, eyes, skin, and urinary tract. It is often triggered by an infection in another part of the body. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it primarily affects the synovial joints but can also involve the spine, leading to symptoms such as back pain, stiffness, and inflammation. Therefore, if a person has reactive arthritis of the spine, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital genu varum of bilateral knees,765067,False,"No

Rationale: Congenital genu varum of bilateral knees refers to a condition where a person has bow legs from birth. While this condition may affect the musculoskeletal system, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are not typically associated with congenital genu varum. Therefore, having congenital genu varum of bilateral knees does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bouchard's node,4066493,True,"Yes, Bouchard's node is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Bouchard's nodes are bony enlargements that develop on the middle joints of the fingers in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. These nodes are a characteristic feature of RA and are not typically seen in other forms of arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has Bouchard's nodes, they are likely to have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital trigger finger and trigger thumb,46270017,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Congenital trigger finger and trigger thumb, on the other hand, are conditions present at birth where a finger or thumb gets stuck in a bent position and may require surgical correction. These conditions are not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis and can occur independently of it. Therefore, having congenital trigger finger and trigger thumb does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finding of finger,4193464,False,"No, the condition ""Finding of finger"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can present with joint swelling, tenderness, and deformities in the fingers, these findings are not exclusive to RA and can be seen in other conditions such as osteoarthritis or trauma. To definitively diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis, additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings need to be considered."
Paget's disease-phalanx of finger or thumb,4002989,False,"No, Paget's disease of the phalanx of the finger or thumb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Paget's disease is a chronic bone disorder characterized by abnormal bone remodeling, leading to enlarged and weakened bones. It typically affects the pelvis, spine, skull, and long bones of the legs, but can also involve the phalanges of the fingers or thumbs. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint inflammation, swelling, and destruction. While both conditions can affect the hands, they have different underlying pathologies and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having Paget's disease of the phalanx of the finger or thumb does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arterial microemboli of left hand,3173537,False,"No, the condition ""Arterial microemboli of left hand"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Arterial microemboli refer to small blood clots that can block blood flow in the arteries, leading to symptoms such as pain, numbness, or discoloration in the affected area. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, it is not directly associated with arterial microemboli. This condition may be indicative of other underlying issues such as atherosclerosis or thromboembolic disorders."
Subluxation of finger,4138155,False,"No

Rationale: Subluxation of the finger is a condition where the bones in the finger joint are partially dislocated. While subluxation of the finger can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint deformities and damage, it is not specific to RA. Subluxation of the finger can also occur in other conditions or due to trauma. Therefore, having subluxation of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Neonatal lupus erythematosus,4316373,False,"No, neonatal lupus erythematosus is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Neonatal lupus erythematosus is a rare condition that occurs in newborns of mothers with certain autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or Sjogren's syndrome. It is characterized by the presence of skin rash, liver abnormalities, and sometimes heart block. While both conditions are autoimmune diseases, they are distinct entities with different clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having neonatal lupus erythematosus does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Acral keratosis,44783167,False,"No, acral keratosis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acral keratosis refers to thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, which is a benign condition. It is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the joints. While skin changes can occur in some autoimmune diseases, acral keratosis is not a specific indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nontraumatic rotator cuff tear,4172970,False,"No

Rationale: A nontraumatic rotator cuff tear is a specific condition that involves a tear in the tendons of the rotator cuff in the shoulder. While it can cause shoulder pain and limited range of motion, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rotator cuff tears can occur due to degenerative changes, overuse, or other factors unrelated to autoimmune inflammatory disorders like RA. Therefore, having a nontraumatic rotator cuff tear does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Recurrent focal palmar peeling,4031658,False,"No, recurrent focal palmar peeling is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Recurrent focal palmar peeling is a condition characterized by the repeated shedding of skin on the palms of the hands. This is more likely to be a dermatological issue rather than a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the joints. While skin manifestations can occur in some autoimmune diseases, recurrent focal palmar peeling is not a typical symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Secondary inflammatory arthritis,4035744,True,"Yes, secondary inflammatory arthritis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Secondary inflammatory arthritis refers to arthritis that develops as a result of another condition, such as an autoimmune disease like RA. Since RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, secondary inflammatory arthritis can be a manifestation of RA. Therefore, if a person has secondary inflammatory arthritis, they may definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause."
Guillain-Barré syndrome,4164770,False,"No, Guillain-Barré syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. It is not directly related to the joint inflammation and destruction seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions involve autoimmune processes, they affect different systems in the body and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria."
Arthritis of pelvis,44783158,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly in the hands and feet. While it is possible for RA to affect the pelvis, it is not a specific characteristic of the disease. Arthritis of the pelvis could be caused by various other conditions such as osteoarthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, having arthritis of the pelvis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Monoarticular chronic primary gouty arthritis,607401,False,"No.

Rationale:
Monoarticular chronic primary gouty arthritis is a specific condition characterized by recurrent episodes of acute inflammatory arthritis due to deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they are two distinct diseases with different etiologies, pathophysiology, and diagnostic criteria. While both conditions can present with joint pain and swelling, the underlying mechanisms and treatment approaches are different. Therefore, having monoarticular chronic primary gouty arthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosing spondylitis with multisystem involvement,4035741,False,"No

Rationale:
Ankylosing spondylitis with multisystem involvement is a separate condition from Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to stiffness, pain, and eventual fusion of the spine. While both conditions are autoimmune inflammatory disorders, they have distinct clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having ankylosing spondylitis with multisystem involvement does not necessarily mean that a person also has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Evaluation finding,40480457,False,"No, the condition ""Evaluation finding"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. ""Evaluation finding"" is a broad term that can encompass a wide range of findings or test results that may or may not be related to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In order to determine if someone has Rheumatoid Arthritis, specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings need to be considered, as mentioned in the description of the malady. Therefore, simply having an ""evaluation finding"" does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acute lymphangitis of upper arm,4023452,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute lymphangitis of the upper arm is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute lymphangitis is an infection of the lymphatic vessels, typically caused by bacteria entering through a break in the skin. It is characterized by red streaks on the skin, swelling, warmth, and tenderness along the affected lymphatic vessels. This condition is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop acute lymphangitis as a secondary infection, the presence of acute lymphangitis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of joint of foot,443557,True,"Yes, the condition ""Disorder of joint of foot"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the feet. Patients with RA often experience joint pain, swelling, and deformities in the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, if someone has a disorder of the joint of the foot, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis, as this condition is a common manifestation of the disease."
Episcleritis,4218083,True,"Yes, episcleritis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Episcleritis is an inflammation of the episclera, which is the thin, transparent layer covering the white part of the eye. It can be associated with autoimmune conditions such as RA. In patients with RA, episcleritis may occur as an extra-articular manifestation of the disease. Therefore, if a patient with RA presents with episcleritis, it is highly likely that the episcleritis is specific to their RA."
Interstitial pneumonia,4273378,False,"No, interstitial pneumonia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While interstitial pneumonia can be a complication of RA due to the chronic inflammation and potential lung involvement in the disease, it is not a defining characteristic of RA. Interstitial pneumonia can also occur in other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, viral infections, and exposure to certain toxins or medications. Therefore, having interstitial pneumonia does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Carbuncle of upper limb,4201700,False,"No

Rationale:
A carbuncle of the upper limb is a localized skin infection involving multiple hair follicles and surrounding tissue, typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a skin infection and not a symptom or characteristic of RA. While individuals with RA may be at a higher risk for infections due to their compromised immune system from the autoimmune disease and immunosuppressive medications, the presence of a carbuncle on the upper limb does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile plantar dermatosis,4031643,False,"No, juvenile plantar dermatosis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Juvenile plantar dermatosis is a skin condition that primarily affects the soles of the feet, causing dry, red, and cracked skin. It is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory joint disorder that is characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis. While some individuals with rheumatoid arthritis may also have skin conditions, juvenile plantar dermatosis is not a defining or specific symptom of rheumatoid arthritis."
Capsulitis of ankle,760994,False,"No, capsulitis of the ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Capsulitis of the ankle is a condition characterized by inflammation of the ligaments surrounding the ankle joint, leading to pain, swelling, and stiffness. While joint involvement is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, capsulitis of the ankle is not a defining characteristic of RA. Additionally, capsulitis of the ankle can be caused by various factors such as overuse, trauma, or improper footwear, rather than being solely associated with RA. Therefore, having capsulitis of the ankle does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Capsulitis of tarsus,760993,False,"No, capsulitis of tarsus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Capsulitis of tarsus is a condition characterized by inflammation of the joint capsule in the midfoot region, specifically affecting the tarsometatarsal joints. It is typically associated with overuse, trauma, or improper footwear. While joint inflammation is a common feature of both conditions, capsulitis of tarsus is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, capsulitis of tarsus is a localized condition, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting multiple joints throughout the body."
Acute polyarthritis,4179092,True,"Yes, acute polyarthritis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute polyarthritis is a condition characterized by inflammation in multiple joints, which is a common presentation in Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, acute polyarthritis typically involves symmetric joint involvement, joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness, which align with the symptoms of acute polyarthritis. Therefore, if a patient presents with acute polyarthritis, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as a potential underlying cause."
Intermittent locking of temporomandibular joint,42536484,False,"No

Rationale: Intermittent locking of the temporomandibular joint is a symptom commonly associated with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD), which is a separate condition from Rheumatoid Arthritis. While some patients with RA may experience symptoms related to the temporomandibular joint, intermittent locking of the joint is not specific to RA and can occur in individuals with TMD or other conditions affecting the jaw joint. Therefore, the presence of intermittent locking of the temporomandibular joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovial osteochondromatosis of distal interphalangeal joint of finger,4068493,False,"No

Rationale: Synovial osteochondromatosis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger is a benign condition characterized by the formation of multiple cartilaginous nodules within the synovial lining of joints. While this condition may cause joint swelling and discomfort, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having synovial osteochondromatosis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger does not definitively mean that an individual has rheumatoid arthritis."
Acute cheiropodopompholyx,4033673,False,"No, acute cheiropodopompholyx is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute cheiropodopompholyx, also known as dyshidrotic eczema, is a skin condition characterized by small blisters on the hands and feet. It is not directly related to the joint inflammation and destruction seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While some patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have skin conditions like eczema, having acute cheiropodopompholyx does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia,36714118,False,"No, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is a rare lung condition characterized by inflammation and scarring in the small airways and air sacs of the lungs. While there have been reported cases of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in a patient with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia."
Arthropathy of joint of hand,443582,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the joint of the hand can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement typically affects the small joints of the hands, leading to symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and deformities. Therefore, if a person has arthropathy of the joint of the hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as a possible underlying cause."
Subungual hematoma of middle finger of right hand,37310081,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma of the middle finger of the right hand is a localized collection of blood underneath the nail, typically caused by trauma to the finger. While this condition can occur in individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) due to joint deformities and increased susceptibility to injury, it is not specific to RA. Subungual hematomas can occur in individuals without RA as well, so the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Disorder of ankle joint,443583,False,"No, a disorder of the ankle joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including the ankle joint, a disorder of the ankle joint can be caused by various other conditions such as trauma, osteoarthritis, gout, or even infection. Therefore, having a disorder of the ankle joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to make a diagnosis of RA in this case."
Subungual hematoma of middle finger of left hand,37310080,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma is a collection of blood underneath the nail, typically caused by trauma to the finger. While it can be a symptom of various conditions, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. In the context of the description provided, there is no direct correlation between a subungual hematoma and rheumatoid arthritis."
Subungual hematoma of index finger of right hand,37310083,False,"No

Rationale: A subungual hematoma of the index finger of the right hand is typically caused by trauma to the nail bed, such as crushing or slamming the finger in a door. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a localized injury rather than a systemic autoimmune disorder affecting the joints. While individuals with RA may experience joint pain and swelling in their fingers, a subungual hematoma is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Subungual hematoma of index finger of left hand,37310082,False,"No

Rationale:
A subungual hematoma of the index finger of the left hand is a condition that involves bleeding under the nail of the finger. While this condition can occur in various situations such as trauma or injury to the finger, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Subungual hematomas are not a characteristic symptom or sign of RA, and having a subungual hematoma does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Therefore, the presence of a subungual hematoma of the index finger of the left hand does not necessarily mean that the individual has rheumatoid arthritis."
Destructive spondylopathy,607413,False,"No, destructive spondylopathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Destructive spondylopathy refers to a condition involving the destruction of the vertebrae in the spine, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, trauma, or other autoimmune conditions like ankylosing spondylitis. While destructive spondylopathy can be seen in some cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not exclusive to this condition and can be present in other diseases as well. Therefore, having destructive spondylopathy does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bursitis of hand,4211842,False,"No

Rationale: Bursitis of the hand is a condition characterized by inflammation of the bursae, which are small fluid-filled sacs that cushion the bones, tendons, and muscles near joints. While bursitis can cause pain, swelling, and tenderness in the affected area, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Bursitis can occur in various joints of the body, including the hand, and can be caused by repetitive movements, injury, or infection. Therefore, having bursitis of the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Abscess of finger,4052222,False,"No

Rationale: An abscess of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may be at a higher risk for developing infections due to their compromised immune system, an abscess of the finger can occur in individuals without Rheumatoid Arthritis as well. An abscess is a localized collection of pus caused by an infection, which can occur in anyone regardless of their underlying medical conditions."
Antisynthetase syndrome,40482477,True,"Yes, the condition of Antisynthetase syndrome is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Antisynthetase syndrome is a rare autoimmune condition characterized by the presence of antisynthetase antibodies, myositis (inflammation of the muscles), interstitial lung disease, arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon, and mechanic's hands. One of the types of arthritis that can be associated with Antisynthetase syndrome is Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has Antisynthetase syndrome, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, not all patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis will have Antisynthetase syndrome."
Chronic disease of musculoskeletal system,4134133,True,"Yes, the condition ""Chronic disease of musculoskeletal system"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, which are part of the musculoskeletal system. Therefore, if someone has a chronic disease affecting the musculoskeletal system, it could potentially be Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the hand,81100,True,"Yes, arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Behcet's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis that can involve joints, and arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome can mimic the joint involvement seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, it is important to note that Behcet's syndrome is a distinct condition with its own set of diagnostic criteria and treatment options."
Osteolysis of right hand,37207801,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteolysis of the right hand refers to the loss or destruction of bone tissue in the right hand. While this condition can be seen in various diseases and conditions, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteolysis can be caused by a variety of factors such as trauma, infection, tumors, or inflammatory conditions other than RA. Therefore, the presence of osteolysis of the right hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteolysis of left hand,37207800,False,"No

Rationale: Osteolysis of the left hand refers to the loss or destruction of bone tissue in the left hand. While this condition may be present in some cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint destruction, it is not specific to RA. Osteolysis can also occur in other conditions such as osteoarthritis, infections, tumors, or trauma. Therefore, the presence of osteolysis of the left hand does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of right wrist,37207782,False,"No.

Rationale:
Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of the right wrist is a specific condition related to the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joint, leading to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and limited range of motion in the affected joint. While this condition may cause joint symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Therefore, having familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of the right wrist does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Tendinitis of elbow or forearm,42872415,False,"No, tendinitis of the elbow or forearm is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tendinitis is inflammation of a tendon, which can occur due to overuse, injury, or other factors. While joint pain and inflammation can be symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis, tendinitis is a separate condition that can occur independently of RA. It is important to consider other factors and symptoms when diagnosing Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of right knee,37207781,False,"No.

Rationale:
Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of the right knee is a specific condition related to the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the knee joint, leading to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. This condition is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis, as it is associated with a different pathophysiology and etiology. While patients with rheumatoid arthritis may develop calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease as a comorbidity, having familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of the right knee does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of left wrist,37207780,False,"No, familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of the left wrist is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) is a condition characterized by the accumulation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. CPPD is not an exclusive feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis and can occur in other conditions such as osteoarthritis. Therefore, having familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of the left wrist does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Interstitial lung disease,4119786,False,"No

Rationale: Interstitial lung disease is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. While interstitial lung disease can be a complication of rheumatoid arthritis, it can also be caused by various other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, environmental exposures, and idiopathic causes. Therefore, having interstitial lung disease does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition of left knee,37207779,False,"No

Rationale: Familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) is a condition characterized by the accumulation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. While this condition can cause symptoms similar to arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas CPPD is caused by the deposition of crystals in the joints. Therefore, having familial CPPD of the left knee does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Acquired deformity of left finger,765150,False,"No

Rationale: An acquired deformity of a left finger is a very nonspecific condition that can have various causes, such as trauma, infection, or other inflammatory conditions. While rheumatoid arthritis can lead to joint deformities in the fingers, the presence of an acquired deformity of a left finger alone is not specific enough to definitively diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. Further evaluation, including clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings, would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in this case."
Foreign body in hand,4058346,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While it is possible for someone with Rheumatoid Arthritis to have a foreign body in their hand, the presence of a foreign body in the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is more likely related to trauma or accidental injury. Therefore, having a foreign body in the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cheiromegaly,607441,False,"No, cheiromegaly is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Cheiromegaly refers to abnormally large hands, which can be caused by a variety of conditions such as acromegaly (excess growth hormone), gigantism, or certain genetic disorders. While some patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may have joint deformities in the hands, cheiromegaly is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having cheiromegaly does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Snapping shoulder,4117735,False,"No

Rationale: A snapping shoulder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Snapping shoulder is a term used to describe a sensation or sound that occurs in the shoulder joint during certain movements. It can be caused by various factors such as tendon or muscle movement over a bony structure, labral tears, or instability of the shoulder joint. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect the shoulder joint, snapping shoulder is not a defining symptom of RA."
Fistula of right knee joint,37207790,False,"No, a fistula of the right knee joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A fistula is an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as an organ or blood vessel. In the context of the knee joint, a fistula could be due to various causes such as infection, trauma, or inflammatory conditions like gout. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint damage and deformities, the presence of a fistula in the knee joint does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings specific to RA would need to be considered for a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Fistula of left knee joint,37207786,False,"No, a fistula of the left knee joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A fistula is an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as an organ or blood vessel. In the context of the left knee joint, a fistula could be due to various causes such as infection, trauma, or inflammatory conditions other than RA. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, the presence of a fistula in the left knee joint alone does not definitively indicate RA. Further evaluation and diagnostic criteria specific to RA would be needed to confirm the presence of the disease in this case."
Sequelae of disorders classified by disorder-system,4181217,False,"No, the condition ""Sequelae of disorders classified by disorder-system"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition refers to the long-term effects or complications that result from a specific disorder affecting a particular system in the body. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can lead to various sequelae such as joint deformities and functional impairment, this condition is not exclusive to Rheumatoid Arthritis and can be seen in other disorders as well. Therefore, having sequelae of disorders classified by disorder-system does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, extended oligoarthritis",4261027,True,"Yes, the condition of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, extended oligoarthritis is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a group of chronic inflammatory diseases affecting children under the age of 16, with extended oligoarthritis being a subtype of JIA. This condition involves inflammation of the synovial joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and potential joint damage. 

Given that Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, it is likely that a patient with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, extended oligoarthritis would also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. The similarities in joint involvement and inflammation support the specificity of this condition to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Thoracic arthritis,4304035,False,"No, thoracic arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Thoracic arthritis refers to inflammation in the joints of the thoracic spine, which can be caused by various conditions such as osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or other inflammatory disorders. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints in the hands and feet, it can also involve the spine. However, thoracic arthritis is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis and can be present in other conditions as well."
Still's disease with juvenile onset and/or adult onset,4261026,True,"Yes, Still's disease with juvenile onset and/or adult onset is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Still's disease is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder that can present with symptoms similar to those of Rheumatoid Arthritis, such as joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness. In some cases, Still's disease can progress to a form of chronic arthritis that resembles Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has Still's disease with juvenile or adult onset, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acquired deformity of hand,4279461,False,"No, the condition ""Acquired deformity of hand"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can lead to deformities in the hands due to joint destruction and inflammation, there are other conditions and factors that can also cause acquired deformities of the hand, such as trauma, osteoarthritis, congenital abnormalities, and other inflammatory arthritic conditions. Therefore, having an acquired deformity of the hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovitis of joint of left foot,605423,True,"Yes, synovitis of the joint of the left foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis, which is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, is a common feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is typically symmetric and affects multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, if a patient presents with synovitis of the joint of the left foot, it could be indicative of RA, especially when considering the chronic autoimmune inflammatory nature of the disease and its preference for affecting the synovial joints."
Lipoid dermatoarthritis,4224167,False,"No.

Rationale:
Lipoid dermatoarthritis is not a recognized medical condition or term in the context of rheumatoid arthritis or any other known medical condition. Therefore, it cannot be considered specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of right hip caused by genus Streptococcus,605409,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right hip caused by genus Streptococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the synovial joints, while the condition mentioned is specifically caused by a bacterial infection with Streptococcus. Although both conditions involve joint inflammation, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Therefore, having the condition does not definitively mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral nodule of subcutaneous tissue of feet,605408,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral nodules of subcutaneous tissue of the feet is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are a common extra-articular manifestation of RA, typically found in areas of pressure or trauma such as the feet. These nodules are firm, non-tender, and can be a key clinical feature in diagnosing RA. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral nodules of subcutaneous tissue of the feet, it strongly suggests the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Extensor hallucis longus tenosynovitis,4000980,True,"Yes, extensor hallucis longus tenosynovitis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Extensor hallucis longus tenosynovitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the tendon sheath of the extensor hallucis longus muscle, which can cause pain and swelling in the foot. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, tenosynovitis is a common manifestation due to the systemic inflammatory nature of the disease. Therefore, if a patient has extensor hallucis longus tenosynovitis, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right ankle caused by genus Streptococcus,605411,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right ankle caused by genus Streptococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described, arthritis of the right ankle caused by genus Streptococcus, suggests an infection of the ankle joint caused by a specific bacterium, Streptococcus. This is more indicative of septic arthritis, which is an infection of the joint rather than an autoimmune condition like Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Therefore, having arthritis of the right ankle caused by genus Streptococcus does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of ligament of right foot joint,37207773,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of ligament of right foot joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is not specifically associated with ligament disorders in the foot joint. RA is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, but ligament disorders are not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having a disorder of the ligament of the right foot joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left hip caused by genus Streptococcus,605410,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left hip caused by genus Streptococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the synovial joints, while the condition mentioned is specifically caused by a bacterial infection with Streptococcus. The presence of Streptococcus as the causative agent indicates a different etiology for the arthritis, making it distinct from the autoimmune nature of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hemarthrosis of distal interphalangeal joint of finger,4117717,False,"No, hemarthrosis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hemarthrosis refers to bleeding into a joint cavity, which can be caused by various factors such as trauma, hemophilia, or other bleeding disorders. While joint involvement is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, hemarthrosis is not a typical presentation of this condition. Therefore, the presence of hemarthrosis in the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of ligament of left foot joint,37207772,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of ligament of left foot joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of RA, the specific description of a disorder of the ligament of the left foot joint does not definitively point to RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, causing inflammation, swelling, and destruction of the joints, rather than specifically targeting ligaments. Additionally, RA typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis involving multiple joints, not just a single ligament in one foot joint. Therefore, the condition described could be indicative of a different issue related to the ligament of the left foot joint, such as a sprain or strain, rather than Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left ankle caused by genus Streptococcus,605412,False,"No.

The condition described, ""Arthritis of left ankle caused by genus Streptococcus,"" specifically mentions an infection caused by Streptococcus bacteria affecting the left ankle joint. This is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. RA is not caused by a bacterial infection but rather by an autoimmune response. While RA can affect multiple joints, it is not specifically linked to a bacterial infection in the ankle joint. Therefore, having arthritis of the left ankle caused by Streptococcus does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Cardiomyopathy associated with another disorder,320746,False,"No, cardiomyopathy associated with another disorder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is primarily a joint disorder, it can also have systemic effects, including cardiovascular involvement such as pericarditis or increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, cardiomyopathy associated with another disorder is a broad condition that can be caused by various underlying diseases or conditions, not just RA. Therefore, having cardiomyopathy associated with another disorder does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tibialis anterior tenosynovitis,4000979,False,"No, tibialis anterior tenosynovitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tibialis anterior tenosynovitis is an inflammation of the tendon sheath of the tibialis anterior muscle, which is responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot. While it can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the systemic nature of the disease, it is not a defining characteristic of RA. Tibialis anterior tenosynovitis can also occur in other conditions such as overuse injuries or trauma."
Extensor tenosynovitis of finger,4000978,False,"No

Rationale: Extensor tenosynovitis of the finger is a condition involving inflammation of the tendon sheath in the fingers, typically causing pain and swelling in the back of the hand and fingers. While this condition can be seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Extensor tenosynovitis can also occur in other conditions such as overuse injuries or inflammatory conditions like psoriatic arthritis. Therefore, having extensor tenosynovitis of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Adductor tendinitis,4000969,False,"No

Rationale: Adductor tendinitis is inflammation of the tendons in the adductor muscles of the hip and thigh, which can cause pain and discomfort in the groin area. While adductor tendinitis can cause pain and discomfort, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are not typically associated with adductor tendinitis. Therefore, having adductor tendinitis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Drug-induced Raynaud's phenomenon,4297909,False,"No

Rationale: Drug-induced Raynaud's phenomenon is a condition where certain medications can trigger vasospasm in the blood vessels, leading to episodes of color changes in the fingers or toes in response to cold or stress. While Raynaud's phenomenon can be a symptom of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, drug-induced Raynaud's phenomenon is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. It can be caused by a variety of medications and does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA."
Biceps tendinitis,4000968,False,"No

Rationale:
Biceps tendinitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the biceps tendon, typically caused by overuse or repetitive movements. While biceps tendinitis can cause pain and swelling in the affected area, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Biceps tendinitis can occur in individuals with or without RA, so having biceps tendinitis does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Foot joint inflamed,4179145,True,"Yes, foot joint inflammation can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint swelling, tenderness, and inflammation are common symptoms, and this can affect the small joints of the hands and feet. Since foot joint inflammation is a common symptom of RA, if a person has foot joint inflammation, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, it is important to consider other factors such as the presence of other symptoms, serological markers, and imaging findings to confirm the diagnosis of RA."
Autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia,4172999,True,"Yes, autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia is a condition where the mother's antibodies attack the baby's platelets, leading to low platelet counts in the newborn. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, and autoimmune conditions can sometimes be linked. In this case, the presence of autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia suggests an underlying autoimmune process, which could be related to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a person has autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia, they may definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Varicose veins of lower extremity with ulcer AND inflammation,193787,False,"No

Rationale:
Varicose veins of lower extremity with ulcer and inflammation are not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted veins that usually occur in the legs and can lead to complications such as ulcers and inflammation. While inflammation can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, varicose veins with ulceration are not characteristic features of RA. Therefore, having varicose veins with ulcer and inflammation does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovitis of joint of right foot,605424,True,"Yes, synovitis of the joint of the right foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis, which is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, is a common feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is typically symmetric and affects multiple joints, including those in the feet. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are all consistent with synovitis. Therefore, if a patient presents with synovitis of the joint of the right foot, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finger joint effusion,4179142,True,"Yes, finger joint effusion is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Finger joint effusion, which is the accumulation of fluid within the joint, is a common finding in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is often seen in the small joints of the hands, which are commonly affected by RA. The presence of finger joint effusion, along with other clinical criteria such as joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings, can help support the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has finger joint effusion, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Calcific tendinitis of right forearm,37207758,False,"No.

Rationale:
Calcific tendinitis of the right forearm is a condition characterized by the formation of calcium deposits within a tendon, leading to pain and limited range of motion. While this condition may cause symptoms in the right forearm, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having calcific tendinitis of the right forearm does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."

Chronic osteomyelitis is a bone infection that can affect any bone in the body, including the knee. It is typically caused by bacteria and can lead to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and fever. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune disease, chronic osteomyelitis is a bone infection and not directly related to RA. Therefore, having chronic osteomyelitis of the knee does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,37312199,False,"No

Rationale: An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a condition specific to the lungs and is not directly related to rheumatoid arthritis, which primarily affects the joints. While patients with rheumatoid arthritis may have an increased risk of developing other conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, an acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is not a defining characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic osteomyelitis of elbow,4117697,False,"No, chronic osteomyelitis of the elbow is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chronic osteomyelitis is a bone infection that can affect any bone in the body, including the elbow. It is typically caused by bacteria and can lead to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and fever. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can cause joint pain and swelling, they have different underlying causes and treatment approaches. Therefore, having chronic osteomyelitis of the elbow does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosis of left knee joint,37207752,True,"Yes, ankylosis of the left knee joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosis refers to the abnormal stiffening and immobility of a joint due to fusion of the bones, which can occur as a result of chronic inflammation and damage in conditions like RA. In RA, the chronic inflammation can lead to joint destruction and deformities, which can ultimately result in ankylosis. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosis of the left knee joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acanthosis palmaris,4080946,False,"No.

Rationale:
Acanthosis palmaris is a skin condition characterized by thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis and does not directly correlate with the malady. While skin manifestations can occur in some autoimmune diseases, acanthosis palmaris is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having acanthosis palmaris does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of shoulder due to renal impairment,46270412,False,"No.

Rationale:
Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. Gout typically affects the big toe but can also involve other joints such as the shoulder. However, gout is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Gout is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having gout of the shoulder due to renal impairment does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Allergic arthritis of the hand,77070,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Allergic arthritis of the hand, on the other hand, suggests an allergic reaction specifically affecting the joints of the hand. While allergies can sometimes trigger inflammatory responses in the joints, allergic arthritis is not a specific condition associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having allergic arthritis of the hand does not definitively mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis of nose,4048178,True,"Yes, the condition ""Granulomatosis with polyangiitis of nose"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a systemic autoimmune vasculitis that primarily affects the respiratory tract, kidneys, and other organs. While GPA and Rheumatoid Arthritis are both autoimmune diseases, they are distinct conditions with different clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having Granulomatosis with polyangiitis of the nose does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of wrist due to renal impairment,46270413,False,"No

Rationale: Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It primarily affects the big toe but can also involve other joints such as the wrist. Gout is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they are two distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. In this case, the presence of gout in the wrist due to renal impairment does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Joint effusion of ankle AND/OR foot,77072,True,"Yes, joint effusion of the ankle and/or foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Joint effusion, or swelling within the joint, is a common symptom of RA due to the inflammation and synovitis that characterizes the disease. In RA, joint effusion is often accompanied by other symptoms such as morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. Additionally, joint effusion in the ankle and foot can be a sign of active disease and joint involvement in RA. Therefore, if a patient presents with joint effusion in the ankle and/or foot, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Lichen planus of palms and soles,4031788,False,"No

Rationale:
Lichen planus of palms and soles is a skin condition characterized by itchy, flat-topped, polygonal, violaceous papules and plaques on the palms and soles. It is a skin condition and not specifically associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. While some autoimmune diseases may have skin manifestations, lichen planus of palms and soles is not a specific indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of hip,4312400,False,"No, tendinitis of the hip is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tendinitis of the hip is inflammation or irritation of the tendons in the hip area, which can be caused by overuse, injury, or underlying conditions such as arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can cause inflammation in multiple joints, including the hips, tendinitis of the hip can occur independently of RA. Therefore, having tendinitis of the hip does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic gout of elbow without tophus due to renal impairment,46270419,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic gout of the elbow without tophus due to renal impairment is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to episodes of severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having chronic gout of the elbow without tophus due to renal impairment does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic tophaceous gout of ankle due to renal impairment,46270416,True,"Yes, chronic tophaceous gout of the ankle due to renal impairment is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale:
Chronic tophaceous gout is a condition characterized by the deposition of urate crystals in the joints, leading to the formation of tophi. This condition is not typically associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, renal impairment is a common complication of chronic tophaceous gout due to the accumulation of urate crystals in the kidneys. Therefore, the presence of chronic tophaceous gout of the ankle due to renal impairment is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic gout of ankle without tophus due to renal impairment,46270417,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition described, chronic gout of the ankle without tophus due to renal impairment, is specific to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness.

Post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the shoulder region,72984,True,"Yes, the condition of post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the shoulder region is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy is a condition that can occur following an episode of dysentery, which is an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhea containing blood or mucus. This condition can lead to joint inflammation and pain, particularly in the shoulder region. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The symptoms of post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the shoulder region align with the symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis, making it specific to this malady. Additionally, the autoimmune nature of Rheumatoid Arthritis can be triggered by infections, such as dysentery, further supporting the connection between the two conditions."
Chronic gout of shoulder without tophus due to renal impairment,46270427,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic gout of the shoulder without tophus due to renal impairment is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to episodes of severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having chronic gout of the shoulder without tophus due to renal impairment does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Axillary hidradenitis suppurativa,4300122,False,"No

Rationale: Axillary hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic skin condition characterized by inflamed, painful lumps in the armpit area. While this condition can coexist with rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having axillary hidradenitis suppurativa does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
"Arthropathy associated with mycoses, of the ankle and/or foot",72989,False,"No.

The condition ""Arthropathy associated with mycoses, of the ankle and/or foot"" refers to joint disease related to fungal infections in the ankle and/or foot. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), as it is caused by a different etiology (fungal infection) and does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints with characteristic symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness, arthropathy associated with mycoses is a result of fungal invasion of the joint space. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that an individual has RA."
Kashin-Beck disease of the ankle and/or foot,75037,False,"No, Kashin-Beck disease of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Kashin-Beck disease is a chronic, endemic, and deforming osteochondropathy characterized by joint pain, swelling, and deformities primarily affecting the ankle and foot joints. It is caused by a combination of environmental factors (e.g., selenium deficiency, mycotoxin exposure) and genetic predisposition. While both conditions involve joint pain and swelling, they have different etiologies, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having Kashin-Beck disease of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease,37312293,True,"Yes, the condition of Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is a rare autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the kidneys and lungs. It is characterized by the presence of antibodies directed against the glomerular basement membrane, leading to inflammation and damage to the kidneys. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the joints, it is also a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the kidneys. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, it is likely that the two conditions are related."
Pyogenic arthritis of hand,72988,True,"Yes, the condition of pyogenic arthritis of the hand is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic arthritis is a type of infectious arthritis caused by bacteria entering the joint space, leading to inflammation and joint damage. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affects the synovial joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While pyogenic arthritis of the hand can occur in other conditions as well, if a patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis, they may develop pyogenic arthritis in the hand due to the underlying joint inflammation and damage characteristic of RA."
Chronic gout of vertebra without tophus due to renal impairment,46270428,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition described, chronic gout of vertebra without tophus due to renal impairment, is specific to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to episodes of severe pain, swelling, and redness. It is not typically associated with the autoimmune mechanisms and joint destruction seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having chronic gout of vertebra without tophus due to renal impairment does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Localized osteoarthrosis uncertain if primary OR secondary,72990,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a distinct autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone changes. The condition of localized osteoarthrosis uncertain if primary or secondary does not specifically point to the autoimmune nature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While some symptoms may overlap, the underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria for each condition are different. Therefore, having the condition of localized osteoarthrosis uncertain if primary or secondary does not definitively mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Autoimmune encephalitis,4318558,False,"No, autoimmune encephalitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Autoimmune encephalitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the brain due to an autoimmune response, leading to symptoms such as confusion, memory problems, seizures, and psychiatric symptoms. While autoimmune diseases like RA can coexist with autoimmune encephalitis, having autoimmune encephalitis does not necessarily mean that a person has RA. The two conditions involve different organs and systems in the body (brain vs. joints), and their diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches are distinct."
Arthritis of right ankle caused by Staphylococcus,37207831,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right ankle caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific cause mentioned in the condition (Staphylococcus infection) is not typically associated with RA. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas an infection caused by Staphylococcus would be considered septic arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis in the right ankle caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right ankle caused by bacteria,42534825,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is not specifically caused by bacteria. It is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues, primarily affecting the synovial joints. While bacterial infections can sometimes lead to arthritis, it is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left wrist caused by Staphylococcus,37207830,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left wrist caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific cause mentioned in the condition (Staphylococcus infection) is not typically associated with RA. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas a Staphylococcus infection would be considered a separate condition requiring specific treatment. Therefore, having arthritis in the left wrist caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left hand caused by bacteria,42534824,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition described, ""Arthritis of left hand caused by bacteria,"" is specific to an infection-related form of arthritis, which is not characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). RA is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, and while infections can trigger RA flares, the primary cause of RA is not bacterial. Therefore, having arthritis of the left hand caused by bacteria does not definitively mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of joint of hand,72995,True,"Yes, contracture of joint of hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Contractures in the hands can occur in patients with RA due to chronic inflammation and joint damage, leading to joint deformities and functional impairment. This condition is commonly seen in patients with RA, making it specific to this malady."
Bilateral congenital knee dislocation,3654933,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Bilateral congenital knee dislocation, on the other hand, is a rare condition present at birth where both knees are dislocated. These two conditions are not directly related, and having bilateral congenital knee dislocation does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left hip caused by Staphylococcus,37207829,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left hip caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described, arthritis of the left hip caused by Staphylococcus, suggests an infectious cause (Staphylococcus bacteria) leading to arthritis in a specific joint (left hip). This is more indicative of septic arthritis, which is different from Rheumatoid Arthritis in terms of etiology and presentation. 

Therefore, having arthritis of the left hip caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic gout of wrist without tophus due to renal impairment,46270432,False,"No, chronic gout of the wrist without tophus due to renal impairment is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints with symmetric polyarthritis, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. It is an autoimmune disease characterized by morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. 

Chronic gout of the wrist without tophus due to renal impairment, on the other hand, is a condition related to gout, which is caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints and tissues, leading to inflammation and pain. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a separate disease entity with different etiology, clinical presentation, and management."
Jaccoud's syndrome,72994,False,"No, Jaccoud's syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Jaccoud's syndrome is a rare condition characterized by reversible joint deformities, typically affecting the hands and feet. It is often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) rather than Rheumatoid Arthritis. While some of the symptoms may overlap with RA, the presence of Jaccoud's syndrome does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Allergic arthritis of the shoulder region,75042,False,"No

Rationale: Allergic arthritis of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Allergic arthritis is typically associated with an allergic reaction to a specific allergen, leading to inflammation in the joints. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. The symptoms and diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis do not align with the description of allergic arthritis of the shoulder region. Therefore, having allergic arthritis of the shoulder region does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left ankle caused by Staphylococcus,37207828,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left ankle caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described, arthritis of the left ankle caused by Staphylococcus, is a specific type of arthritis caused by a bacterial infection rather than an autoimmune process like RA. 

While RA can affect any joint in the body, the specific cause of arthritis in the left ankle due to Staphylococcus is not a typical presentation of RA. Therefore, having arthritis of the left ankle caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Open fracture of intercondylar spine of left tibia,37310234,False,"No, an open fracture of the intercondylar spine of the left tibia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. An open fracture is a traumatic injury to the bone, typically caused by external force or trauma, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially experience fractures due to weakened bones from the disease, an open fracture of the tibia is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left ankle caused by bacteria,42534826,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left ankle caused by bacteria"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis caused by bacteria in the left ankle would likely be a result of a bacterial infection rather than an autoimmune process. While bacterial arthritis can cause joint inflammation and damage, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic bucket handle tear of lateral meniscus of left knee,765231,False,"No

Rationale: A chronic bucket handle tear of the lateral meniscus of the left knee is a specific condition related to a tear in the meniscus of the knee joint. While this condition may cause symptoms such as knee pain and swelling, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint deformities, and functional impairment. Therefore, having a chronic bucket handle tear of the lateral meniscus of the left knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of left hip,42534829,False,"No, infective arthritis of the left hip is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is a bacterial infection of a joint that can affect any joint in the body, including the hip. It is characterized by joint pain, swelling, warmth, and decreased range of motion. The presence of infective arthritis of the left hip does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a separate condition caused by a bacterial infection rather than an autoimmune disorder like RA. Additional diagnostic criteria, such as serological markers and imaging findings specific to RA, would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in this case."
Open fracture of intercondylar spine of right tibia,37310236,False,"No, an open fracture of the intercondylar spine of the right tibia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. An open fracture is a traumatic injury to the bone, typically caused by a direct blow or force, leading to a break in the skin and exposure of the bone. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While individuals with RA may experience joint pain and swelling, an open fracture is a distinct traumatic injury and not a symptom or characteristic feature of RA."
Infective arthritis of right shoulder,42534828,False,"No, the condition ""Infective arthritis of right shoulder"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is a condition caused by an infection in the joint. It is characterized by joint pain, swelling, redness, and limited range of motion. The infection can be bacterial, viral, or fungal in nature. 

While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and presents with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, it is an autoimmune disease and not caused by an infection. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the right shoulder does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic gout of hand without tophus caused by drug,46270439,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic gout of the hand without tophus caused by drug is a specific condition that is not necessarily indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and RA are inflammatory joint conditions, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having chronic gout of the hand without tophus caused by drug does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of left ankle,42534831,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition of infective arthritis of the left ankle specifically refers to an infection in the left ankle joint. While infective arthritis can present with similar symptoms such as joint swelling and tenderness, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis is caused by an infection in the joint, often bacterial, and requires specific treatment such as antibiotics. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the left ankle does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of right hip,42534830,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While infective arthritis can also affect the joints, it is typically caused by an infection rather than an autoimmune response. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the right hip does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. The two conditions have different underlying causes and mechanisms."
Chronic gout of elbow without tophus caused by drug,46270437,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic gout of the elbow without tophus caused by a drug is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Therefore, having chronic gout of the elbow without tophus caused by a drug does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Systemic sclerosis,134442,False,"No, systemic sclerosis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, is a chronic autoimmune connective tissue disorder characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. While both systemic sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis are autoimmune diseases, they affect different parts of the body and have distinct clinical features and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having systemic sclerosis does not necessarily mean that a person also has rheumatoid arthritis."
Juvenile osteochondritis of left foot,765219,False,"No.

Rationale:
Juvenile osteochondritis of the left foot is a condition that affects the cartilage and bone in the foot, typically seen in children and adolescents. While this condition may cause joint pain and swelling in the foot, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having juvenile osteochondritis of the left foot does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic gout of knee without tophus caused by drug,46270443,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic gout of the knee without tophus caused by drug is a specific condition that is not typically associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and RA are inflammatory joint conditions, they have different underlying causes and clinical presentations. Therefore, having chronic gout of the knee without tophus caused by drug does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pigmented villonodular synovitis of joint of right knee,37207837,False,"No

Rationale: Pigmented villonodular synovitis of the joint of the right knee is a benign proliferative disorder of the synovium that can cause joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. While these symptoms may overlap with those of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pigmented villonodular synovitis is not specific to RA. Therefore, having pigmented villonodular synovitis of the joint of the right knee does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Bilateral inflammation of sacroiliac joint,761120,True,"Yes, bilateral inflammation of the sacroiliac joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Inflammation of the sacroiliac joint is a common feature of RA, particularly in the early stages of the disease. This symptom, along with other clinical criteria such as joint involvement and serological markers, can help in the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral inflammation of the sacroiliac joint, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pigmented villonodular synovitis of joint of left knee,37207836,False,"No

Rationale: Pigmented villonodular synovitis of the joint of the left knee is a benign proliferative disorder of the synovium that can cause joint swelling and pain. While it can present with symptoms similar to rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Therefore, having pigmented villonodular synovitis of the joint of the left knee does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic gout of hip without tophus caused by drug,46270441,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic gout of the hip without tophus caused by drug is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes, symptoms, and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having chronic gout of the hip without tophus caused by drug does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of left elbow caused by bacteria,42534821,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis of the left elbow caused by bacteria suggests an infection-related arthritis, which is not specific to RA. While RA can affect multiple joints symmetrically, it is not directly caused by a bacterial infection. Therefore, having arthritis of the left elbow caused by bacteria does not definitively mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic tophaceous gout of shoulder caused by drug,46270446,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic tophaceous gout of the shoulder caused by a drug is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to episodes of severe pain, swelling, and redness. Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints with characteristic features such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While both conditions can affect joints, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having chronic tophaceous gout of the shoulder caused by a drug does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic gout of shoulder without tophus caused by drug,46270447,False,"No

Rationale:
Chronic gout of the shoulder without tophus caused by drug is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a separate condition caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to inflammation and pain. While both gout and RA are inflammatory joint conditions, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having chronic gout of the shoulder without tophus caused by drug does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right wrist caused by Staphylococcus,37207833,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right wrist caused by Staphylococcus"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While arthritis can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific cause mentioned in the condition (Staphylococcus infection) is not typically associated with RA. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas a Staphylococcus infection leading to arthritis would be considered septic arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis of the right wrist caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left wrist caused by bacteria,42534823,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is not specifically caused by bacteria. It is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues, primarily affecting the synovial joints. While bacterial infections can sometimes trigger reactive arthritis, it is not the primary cause of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having arthritis of the left wrist caused by bacteria does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tenosynovitis of elbow,3521818,False,"No, tenosynovitis of the elbow is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tenosynovitis is inflammation of the tendon sheath, which can occur in various conditions such as overuse injuries, trauma, or infection. While tenosynovitis can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a specific indicator of the disease. In RA, the primary symptoms are joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, rather than isolated tenosynovitis of the elbow."
Arthritis of right hip caused by Staphylococcus,37207832,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, ""Arthritis of right hip caused by Staphylococcus,"" is a specific type of arthritis caused by a bacterial infection, specifically Staphylococcus. This is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While RA can affect the hip joint, it is not caused by a bacterial infection like Staphylococcus. Therefore, having arthritis of the right hip caused by Staphylococcus does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right wrist caused by bacteria,42534822,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right wrist caused by bacteria"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, while arthritis caused by bacteria is typically a result of an infection in the joint. The presence of bacteria causing arthritis in the right wrist does not necessarily mean that the individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis. The two conditions have different etiologies and require different treatment approaches."
Hypocalcemia,435510,False,"No, hypocalcemia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hypocalcemia is a condition characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood, which can be caused by various factors such as vitamin D deficiency, kidney disease, or certain medications. While hypocalcemia can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to factors such as malnutrition or medication side effects, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having hypocalcemia does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of left foot,42534843,False,"No

Rationale:
Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It primarily affects the big toe but can also involve other joints, including the foot. While gouty arthritis can present with similar symptoms to rheumatoid arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints, while gouty arthritis is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the left foot does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic gout of vertebra without tophus caused by drug,46270449,False,"No, chronic gout of vertebra without tophus caused by drug is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. It is an autoimmune disease characterized by morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. On the other hand, chronic gout of vertebra without tophus caused by drug is a condition related to gout, which is a different type of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to inflammation and pain. 

While both conditions involve joint pain and inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having chronic gout of vertebra without tophus caused by drug does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of elbow caused by drug,46270454,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Gout, on the other hand, is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. Gout typically affects the big toe but can also affect other joints such as the elbow. The fact that the condition is specified as ""Gout of elbow caused by drug"" suggests a specific cause for the gout flare-up, which is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having gout of the elbow caused by a drug does not necessarily mean that the individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Brucella spondylitis,4068619,False,"No, Brucella spondylitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Brucella spondylitis is a rare infection of the spine caused by the bacteria Brucella. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and require different treatment approaches."
Gout of hand caused by drug,46270455,False,"No, gout of the hand caused by a drug is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and RA are forms of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Gout is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, leading to the formation of crystals, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints. Additionally, gout typically affects larger joints such as the big toe, whereas RA primarily affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, the presence of gout of the hand caused by a drug does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of glenohumeral joint,4328821,False,"No

Rationale: A disorder of the glenohumeral joint is a specific condition related to the shoulder joint, which is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet, it is not specifically associated with the glenohumeral joint. Therefore, having a disorder of the glenohumeral joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of ankle and/or foot caused by drug,46270453,False,"No

Rationale: Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It primarily affects the big toe but can also involve other joints such as the ankle and foot. Gout is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they are two distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. While some symptoms of gout may overlap with RA, the presence of gout of the ankle and/or foot caused by a drug does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of right ankle,42534832,False,"No, infective arthritis of the right ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis is caused by an infection in the joint, leading to inflammation and symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can present with joint symptoms, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the right ankle does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of shoulder caused by drug,46270459,False,"No, the condition ""Gout of shoulder caused by drug"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune disorder. Additionally, the fact that the gout is caused by a drug suggests a different etiology than RA. Therefore, having gout of the shoulder caused by a drug does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder,761136,False,"No, bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While temporomandibular joint disorder can be seen in patients with RA, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly in the hands and feet, and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis. Temporomandibular joint disorder, on the other hand, specifically involves the jaw joint and surrounding muscles. Therefore, having bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hypo-osmolality and or hyponatremia,435515,False,"No, hypo-osmolality and/or hyponatremia are not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. These conditions refer to low osmolality (concentration of solutes in a solution) and low sodium levels in the blood, respectively. While these conditions can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are not exclusive to this malady and can be seen in a variety of other medical conditions such as heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease, and certain medications. Therefore, the presence of hypo-osmolality and/or hyponatremia does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of vertebra caused by drug,46270460,False,"No

Rationale:
Gout of vertebra caused by drug is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and RA are inflammatory joint conditions, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints. Additionally, gout typically affects larger joints like the big toe, while RA primarily affects smaller joints like those in the hands and feet. Therefore, the presence of gout of vertebra caused by drug does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gout of wrist caused by drug,46270461,False,"No

Rationale:
Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It typically affects the big toe but can also involve other joints such as the wrist. Gout is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they are two distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. While it is possible for a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis to also develop gout, having gout of the wrist caused by a drug does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis in this case."
Disorder of lumbar spine,195906,False,"No, a disorder of the lumbar spine is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is not typically associated with specific lumbar spine disorders. RA is more commonly associated with joint involvement in the hands and feet, as well as other joints in the body. Therefore, having a disorder of the lumbar spine does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Discitis,4046205,False,"No

Rationale: Discitis is an infection or inflammation of the intervertebral disc space, typically caused by bacteria. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a separate condition affecting the spine rather than the synovial joints. While a patient with RA may potentially develop discitis as a complication, having discitis does not definitively mean that the patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of midtarsal joint of left foot,42534857,False,"No, osteoarthritis of the midtarsal joint of the left foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is different from Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and treatment approaches. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the midtarsal joint of the left foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of midtarsal joint of right foot,42534856,False,"No, osteoarthritis of the midtarsal joint of the right foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While both osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and characteristics. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the midtarsal joint of the right foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Short stature locking fingers syndrome,37111668,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Short stature locking fingers syndrome"" does not specifically point to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is primarily characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. The description of the condition provided does not align with the key clinical features of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having the condition does not definitively mean that an individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of left foot due to trauma,42534859,False,"No.

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the joints and cause pain, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left foot due to trauma does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral arthritis of glenohumeral joints,42534861,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral arthritis of glenohumeral joints is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, meaning that it affects joints on both sides of the body. The presence of bilateral arthritis in the glenohumeral joints (shoulder joints) fits this pattern of symmetric joint involvement seen in RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are all features that can be present in arthritis of the glenohumeral joints. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral arthritis of the glenohumeral joints, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left sternoclavicular joint,42534862,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of left sternoclavicular joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, including the sternoclavicular joint. The presence of arthritis in the left sternoclavicular joint would be consistent with the joint involvement seen in RA. Additionally, the symmetric polyarthritis characteristic of RA can involve multiple joints on both sides of the body, including the sternoclavicular joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the left sternoclavicular joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of temporomandibular joint,4240648,False,"No

Rationale: Arthritis of the temporomandibular joint is a condition specific to the temporomandibular joint, which is the joint that connects the jaw to the skull. While rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the hands and feet, it is not specific to the temporomandibular joint. Therefore, having arthritis of the temporomandibular joint does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of right foot due to trauma,42534853,False,"No.

The condition ""Arthritis of right foot due to trauma"" does not specifically indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. While trauma can lead to arthritis in the affected joint, Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints and is not directly caused by trauma. Additionally, the description of Rheumatoid Arthritis mentions specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings that are used to diagnose the condition, none of which are mentioned in the provided condition. Therefore, having arthritis in the right foot due to trauma does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left foot due to trauma,42534854,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of left foot due to trauma"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While trauma can lead to arthritis in the affected joint, the description of Rheumatoid Arthritis specifies that it is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. In this case, the arthritis in the left foot is attributed to trauma, not an autoimmune process. Therefore, having arthritis in the left foot due to trauma does not definitively mean that the individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of flexor digitorum superficialis,4001133,True,"Yes, contracture of flexor digitorum superficialis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, chronic inflammation in the synovial joints can lead to joint deformities and contractures, including contracture of flexor digitorum superficialis. This condition can result in the inability to fully extend the fingers, which is a common manifestation of RA. Therefore, if a patient has contracture of flexor digitorum superficialis, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Repetitive motion disorder of left hand,37312363,False,"No, the condition of a repetitive motion disorder of the left hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can cause joint pain and swelling in the hands, a repetitive motion disorder is a separate condition that is typically caused by overuse or repetitive movements of the hand and wrist. It is important to consider other factors such as the patient's occupation, activities, and any other symptoms they may be experiencing to determine the cause of their left hand disorder."
Infective myositis of upper arm,4001124,False,"No

Rationale: Infective myositis of the upper arm refers to an infection of the muscle tissue in the upper arm, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not specifically involve muscle infections. Therefore, having infective myositis of the upper arm does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right midtarsal joint,42534864,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of right midtarsal joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. The presence of arthritis in the midtarsal joint of the right foot aligns with the pattern of joint involvement seen in RA. Additionally, the chronic autoimmune inflammatory nature of RA can lead to joint destruction and deformities, which can manifest as arthritis in the midtarsal joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the right midtarsal joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteitis of lower leg,4097380,False,"No, osteitis of the lower leg is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteitis refers to inflammation of the bone, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, trauma, or other inflammatory conditions. While joint involvement is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, osteitis specifically refers to inflammation of the bone itself rather than the joints. Therefore, having osteitis of the lower leg does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional evaluation and diagnostic criteria specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis would be needed to confirm the diagnosis."
Celiac disease with epilepsy and cerebral calcification syndrome,36716394,False,"No

Rationale:
Celiac disease with epilepsy and cerebral calcification syndrome is a specific condition that involves a combination of celiac disease, epilepsy, and cerebral calcifications. While celiac disease can be associated with other conditions, including neurological manifestations such as epilepsy, the presence of cerebral calcifications is not a typical feature of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having celiac disease with epilepsy and cerebral calcification syndrome does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Infective myositis of thigh,4001126,False,"No

Rationale:
Infective myositis of the thigh refers to an infection of the muscle tissue in the thigh, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not specifically involve infective myositis of the thigh. Therefore, having infective myositis of the thigh does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral medial epicondylitis of elbows,761175,False,"No, bilateral medial epicondylitis of the elbows is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Bilateral medial epicondylitis of the elbows is a condition characterized by inflammation of the tendons on the inner side of the elbow. It is commonly known as golfer's elbow and is typically caused by repetitive stress or overuse of the forearm muscles. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect multiple joints, including the elbows, bilateral medial epicondylitis is a localized condition that is not a defining feature of RA. Therefore, having bilateral medial epicondylitis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of right foot,42534869,False,"No

Rationale: A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the right foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance in the tissue, which is not a characteristic feature of RA. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with foreign body granulomas in the soft tissue. Therefore, having a foreign body granuloma of the soft tissue of the right foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Lateral epicondylitis of bilateral humerus,761174,False,"No.

Rationale:
Lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, is a condition characterized by pain and inflammation on the outer part of the elbow. While it is possible for someone with rheumatoid arthritis to also have lateral epicondylitis, the presence of lateral epicondylitis does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which is different from the localized pain and inflammation seen in lateral epicondylitis. Therefore, the condition of lateral epicondylitis of bilateral humerus is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Synovitis of right ankle joint,42534871,True,"Yes, synovitis of the right ankle joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis, which is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, is a common feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is typically symmetric and affects multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, if a patient presents with synovitis of the right ankle joint, it could be indicative of RA, especially if there are other signs and symptoms consistent with the disease. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of synovitis, such as infection or trauma, and to perform further evaluation and testing to confirm the diagnosis of RA."
Repetitive motion disorder of right hand,37312358,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While repetitive motion disorder of the right hand may cause symptoms such as pain and stiffness in the hand, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. There are various other conditions that can cause similar symptoms in the hand, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or osteoarthritis. Therefore, having a repetitive motion disorder of the right hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of left foot,42534870,False,"No.

Rationale:
A foreign body granuloma of soft tissue of the left foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A foreign body granuloma is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign substance, such as a splinter or implant material, and is not a characteristic feature of RA. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with foreign body granulomas in the soft tissue of the foot. Therefore, having a foreign body granuloma of the soft tissue of the left foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pericarditis secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus,4101469,True,"Yes, pericarditis secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus is specific to rheumatoid arthritis.

Rationale:
Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. It can be a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is another autoimmune disease. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a separate autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the joints, and pericarditis secondary to SLE is not a common manifestation of RA. Therefore, if a patient has pericarditis secondary to SLE, they definitely have SLE but may not have RA."
Keratodermia tylodes palmaris progressiva,605549,False,"No, keratodermia tylodes palmaris progressiva is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Keratodermia tylodes palmaris progressiva is a rare genetic disorder characterized by thickening of the skin on the palms and soles, which can lead to pain and difficulty with walking and using the hands. It is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in rheumatoid arthritis. While a patient with rheumatoid arthritis may also have keratodermia tylodes palmaris progressiva, the presence of the skin condition does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Synovial cyst of knee,4347174,False,"No

Rationale:
A synovial cyst of the knee is a fluid-filled sac that develops in the knee joint due to underlying conditions such as osteoarthritis or meniscal tears. While it can cause symptoms such as swelling and pain in the knee joint, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having a synovial cyst of the knee does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Fibrositis arm,4003160,False,"No, fibrositis arm is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Fibrositis, also known as fibromyalgia, is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tender points. While joint pain and stiffness can be symptoms of both fibromyalgia and Rheumatoid Arthritis, fibromyalgia does not involve the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in RA. Additionally, fibromyalgia does not typically lead to joint destruction or deformities as seen in RA. Therefore, having fibrositis arm does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pain of right hand due to and following cerebrovascular accident,765283,False,"No, the condition ""Pain of right hand due to and following cerebrovascular accident"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described, pain in the right hand following a cerebrovascular accident (stroke), is more likely related to nerve damage or muscle weakness resulting from the stroke rather than the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

While it is possible for a person to have both conditions simultaneously, the presence of pain in the right hand following a stroke does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral tendonitis of patellar tendon,761185,False,"No

Rationale:
Bilateral tendonitis of the patellar tendon is a condition that involves inflammation of the patellar tendons in both knees. While this condition can cause pain and swelling in the knees, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Tendonitis can be caused by overuse, injury, or other factors unrelated to autoimmune conditions like RA. Therefore, having bilateral tendonitis of the patellar tendon does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Eczema of lower limb,37312343,False,"No

Rationale: Eczema of the lower limb is a skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed patches of skin. While it is possible for a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis to also have eczema, eczema is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Eczema is a separate skin condition that is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that is Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having eczema of the lower limb does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Lipogranulomatosis subcutanea of Rothmann and Makai,4197679,False,"No, lipogranulomatosis subcutanea of Rothmann and Makai is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Lipogranulomatosis subcutanea of Rothmann and Makai is a rare benign inflammatory disorder characterized by the presence of lipid-laden macrophages in the subcutaneous tissue. It typically presents as painless subcutaneous nodules or plaques. There is no known association between lipogranulomatosis subcutanea of Rothmann and Makai and Rheumatoid Arthritis based on current medical knowledge."
Chronic osteoarthritis,4185423,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. While both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis are types of arthritis, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. RA is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the synovial joints, while osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition that primarily affects the cartilage in weight-bearing joints. Therefore, having chronic osteoarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has RA, as the two conditions are distinct entities with different pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria."
Contracture of flexor digitorum profundus,4003150,True,"Yes, contracture of flexor digitorum profundus can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, chronic inflammation in the synovial joints can lead to joint deformities and contractures, including contracture of flexor digitorum profundus. This condition is often seen in advanced stages of RA due to the joint destruction and damage caused by the disease process. Therefore, if a patient has contracture of flexor digitorum profundus, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Polymyalgia rheumatica,255348,False,"No, polymyalgia rheumatica is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Polymyalgia rheumatica is a separate inflammatory condition characterized by muscle pain and stiffness, typically in the shoulders, neck, and hips. It is not primarily a joint disease like rheumatoid arthritis. While both conditions are inflammatory in nature, they have distinct clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having polymyalgia rheumatica does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Kashin-Beck disease of the shoulder region,439678,False,"No.

Rationale:
Kashin-Beck disease is a chronic, endemic osteochondropathy that primarily affects the joints, particularly the wrists, elbows, and knees. It is characterized by joint pain, stiffness, and deformities due to cartilage and bone abnormalities. The condition is not specific to the shoulder region, as it typically affects multiple joints in the body. Therefore, the presence of Kashin-Beck disease of the shoulder region does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Secondary nonischemic congestive cardiomyopathy,44783568,True,"Yes, secondary nonischemic congestive cardiomyopathy is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Secondary nonischemic congestive cardiomyopathy can be a complication of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In patients with RA, chronic inflammation can lead to systemic effects, including cardiovascular complications such as cardiomyopathy. Therefore, if a patient has secondary nonischemic congestive cardiomyopathy, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Degeneration of lumbar intervertebral disc,443769,False,"No

Rationale: Degeneration of lumbar intervertebral disc is a condition that primarily affects the spine, specifically the intervertebral discs in the lumbar region. While this condition may cause back pain and stiffness, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints. Therefore, having degeneration of lumbar intervertebral disc does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Polydactyly of fingers of left hand,761230,False,"No

Rationale: Polydactyly of fingers of the left hand is a congenital condition characterized by the presence of extra fingers on the hand. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a physical anomaly present at birth and not a symptom or sign of RA. While a person with RA may also have polydactyly, the presence of polydactyly does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Polydactyly of fingers of right hand,761228,False,"No, polydactyly of fingers of the right hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Polydactyly is a congenital condition characterized by the presence of extra fingers or toes. It is not a symptom or sign of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the joints and is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Therefore, having polydactyly of the fingers of the right hand does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteitis,4167096,False,"No, osteitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Osteitis refers to inflammation of the bone, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, trauma, or other inflammatory conditions. While osteitis can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the inflammatory nature of the disease, it is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having osteitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of metatarsophalangeal joint of lesser toe,40493024,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Infective arthritis of metatarsophalangeal joint of lesser toe"" refers to a specific type of arthritis caused by an infection in the joint of the lesser toe. This is a localized infection-related arthritis, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the lesser toe does not necessarily mean that a person has RA."
Monoarticular joint involvement,4097458,False,"No

Rationale: While monoarticular joint involvement can be seen in some cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not specific to this malady. Monoarticular joint involvement can also be seen in other conditions such as osteoarthritis, gout, or septic arthritis. Therefore, having monoarticular joint involvement does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Livedoid vasculitis of lower limb due to varicose veins of lower limb,42538758,False,"No

Rationale:
Livedoid vasculitis of the lower limb due to varicose veins is a condition characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin, leading to painful ulcers and skin discoloration. While this condition may present in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Livedoid vasculitis can be seen in various other conditions as well, such as vasculitis, connective tissue diseases, and hypercoagulable states. Therefore, having livedoid vasculitis of the lower limb due to varicose veins does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Disorder of thoracic spine,443795,False,"No, a disorder of the thoracic spine is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the spine, a disorder of the thoracic spine could be caused by various other conditions such as degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, or trauma. Therefore, having a disorder of the thoracic spine does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ulnar neuritis,4318678,False,"No, ulnar neuritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ulnar neuritis refers to inflammation or irritation of the ulnar nerve, which can cause symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers. While ulnar neuritis can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint inflammation and compression of the nerve, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Ulnar neuritis can also be caused by other conditions such as cubital tunnel syndrome or trauma to the elbow. Therefore, having ulnar neuritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital deformity of left knee joint,761258,False,"No, the condition ""Congenital deformity of left knee joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. A congenital deformity of the left knee joint is a structural abnormality present from birth and is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop joint deformities over time, a congenital deformity is not a direct symptom or diagnostic criterion for RA."
Tenosynovitis of ankle,433572,False,"No

Rationale: Tenosynovitis of the ankle is inflammation of the tendon sheath in the ankle, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While tenosynovitis can occur in patients with RA, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, rather than specifically causing tenosynovitis in the ankle. Therefore, having tenosynovitis of the ankle does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis,37017494,False,"No.

Rationale:
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis is a distinct condition from Rheumatoid Arthritis. Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis is a type of spondyloarthritis that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to inflammatory back pain and stiffness. It is characterized by the absence of definitive radiographic evidence of sacroiliitis on X-ray, which is a key feature that distinguishes it from ankylosing spondylitis. While both conditions are autoimmune inflammatory disorders, they affect different joints and have different diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteitis of forearm,4183450,False,"No

Rationale: Osteitis of the forearm is inflammation of the bone in the forearm, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can cause joint inflammation and damage in the forearm, osteitis specifically refers to bone inflammation, which is not a defining characteristic of RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, not the bones themselves. Therefore, having osteitis of the forearm does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital absence of entire right hand,761261,False,"No, the condition of congenital absence of the entire right hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The absence of an entire hand is a physical anomaly present from birth and is not a symptom or characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having the condition of congenital absence of the entire right hand does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deformity of right foot,3655068,True,"Yes, deformity of the right foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction can lead to deformities in the hands and feet, particularly in the small joints. Deformities in the feet, such as bunions or claw toes, can be a manifestation of RA. Therefore, if a patient has a deformity of the right foot, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deformity of left foot,3655067,True,"Yes, deformity of the left foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction and deformities are common manifestations of the disease, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. Deformities in the foot, such as bunions, claw toes, or hammer toes, can result from chronic inflammation and joint damage in RA. Therefore, if a patient presents with a deformity of the left foot, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Neoplasm of acromion,4054416,False,"No, the condition ""Neoplasm of acromion"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A neoplasm refers to an abnormal growth of cells, which can be benign or malignant. The presence of a neoplasm of the acromion, which is a part of the shoulder blade, does not necessarily indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it is not directly associated with neoplasms. Therefore, having a neoplasm of the acromion does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Fibrosis of lung caused by radiation,4322799,False,"No, fibrosis of the lung caused by radiation is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, fibrosis of the lung caused by radiation is a separate condition that involves scarring of the lung tissue due to exposure to radiation. These two conditions involve different pathophysiological processes and do not have a direct causal relationship."
Kümmell disease,4345330,False,"No, Kümmell disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Kümmell disease, also known as avascular necrosis of the vertebral body, is a rare condition characterized by delayed collapse of a vertebral body following a minor trauma, leading to severe back pain and spinal deformity. It is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop spinal complications, such as osteoporosis or vertebral fractures, Kümmell disease is a distinct entity with its own etiology and pathophysiology."
Congenital dislocation of left knee,761274,False,"No

Rationale: Congenital dislocation of the left knee is a specific condition related to a malformation present at birth where the knee joint is dislocated. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as RA primarily affects the synovial joints with characteristic symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While RA can affect multiple joints in the body, it does not specifically cause congenital dislocation of the knee."
Villonodular synovitis of distal interphalangeal joint of finger,4117896,True,"Yes, Villonodular synovitis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Villonodular synovitis is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of synovial tissue in joints, leading to pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the synovial tissue in the joints is also affected, leading to similar symptoms. Therefore, if a patient has Villonodular synovitis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital genu recurvatum of right knee,761276,False,"No

Rationale: Congenital genu recurvatum of the right knee is a condition characterized by hyperextension of the knee joint, causing the knee to bend backward. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a structural abnormality present at birth and is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that defines RA. While a patient with RA may also have congenital genu recurvatum, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Villonodular synovitis of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger,4117895,True,"Yes, the condition of Villonodular synovitis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Villonodular synovitis is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of synovial tissue in joints, which can lead to joint swelling, pain, and stiffness. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the synovial joints are primarily affected, and the symptoms of joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction are consistent with those seen in Villonodular synovitis. Therefore, if a patient has Villonodular synovitis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger, they are likely to have Rheumatoid Arthritis as well."
Villonodular synovitis of metacarpophalangeal joint,4117893,True,"Yes, Villonodular synovitis of the metacarpophalangeal joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Villonodular synovitis is a rare benign proliferative disorder of the synovium that can occur in the joints, including the metacarpophalangeal joint. In the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the presence of Villonodular synovitis in the metacarpophalangeal joint can be a manifestation of the chronic inflammatory process characteristic of RA. Therefore, if a patient has Villonodular synovitis of the metacarpophalangeal joint, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital genu valgum of bilateral knees,761271,False,"No, congenital genu valgum of bilateral knees is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Congenital genu valgum refers to a condition where the knees angle inwards and is present from birth. This is a structural abnormality of the knees and is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that characterizes Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint deformities, including in the knees, congenital genu valgum is not a defining characteristic of the disease."
Hemarthrosis of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger,4117891,True,"Yes, hemarthrosis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hemarthrosis refers to bleeding into a joint, which can occur in RA due to inflammation and damage to the synovial lining of the joint. In RA, the small joints of the hands, including the proximal interphalangeal joints, are commonly affected, leading to symptoms such as joint swelling, pain, and deformities. Therefore, if a patient presents with hemarthrosis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Palmoplantar keratoderma,45768452,False,"No

Rationale: Palmoplantar keratoderma is a condition characterized by thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. While it can be associated with certain genetic conditions or syndromes, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having palmoplantar keratoderma does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Disorder of acromioclavicular joint,44783380,False,"No, a disorder of the acromioclavicular joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. The acromioclavicular joint is a separate joint from the synovial joints primarily affected by RA. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, a disorder of the acromioclavicular joint may be due to other causes such as trauma or degenerative changes. Therefore, having a disorder of the acromioclavicular joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of left hip,761291,False,"No

Rationale: Tendinitis of the left hip is a condition involving inflammation of the tendons in the hip joint, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint pain and inflammation are common symptoms in both conditions, tendinitis of the left hip is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, leading to symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having tendinitis of the left hip does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosing spondylitis co-occurrent with anterior uveitis,37203959,True,"Yes, ankylosing spondylitis co-occurrent with anterior uveitis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, while anterior uveitis is inflammation of the uvea in the eye. Both of these conditions can be extra-articular manifestations of RA, meaning they can occur in patients with RA. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosing spondylitis co-occurrent with anterior uveitis, it is highly likely that they also have RA."
Tendinitis of right hip,761292,False,"No

Rationale: Tendinitis of the right hip is a condition involving inflammation of the tendons in the hip joint, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint pain and inflammation are common symptoms in both conditions, tendinitis of the right hip is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having tendinitis of the right hip does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hypothenar hammer syndrome,40480686,False,"No, hypothenar hammer syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Hypothenar hammer syndrome is a condition caused by repetitive trauma to the hypothenar eminence (the fleshy mass on the palm at the base of the little finger) leading to vascular insufficiency and thrombosis of the ulnar artery. It is typically seen in individuals who engage in activities that involve repetitive trauma to the hand, such as using a hammer. 

While both Rheumatoid Arthritis and hypothenar hammer syndrome can affect the hands, they are distinct conditions with different etiologies and pathophysiology. Therefore, having hypothenar hammer syndrome does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."

Rationale:
Tendinitis of bilateral gluteal tendons is a condition that involves inflammation of the tendons in the buttocks area. While this condition may cause pain and discomfort in the affected area, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having tendinitis of bilateral gluteal tendons does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot,81373,True,"Yes, the condition of post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy is a condition that can occur following an episode of dysentery, which is an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhea containing blood or mucus. This condition can lead to joint inflammation, particularly in the ankle and foot joints. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition of post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot can be a manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it involves joint inflammation and can be a result of the autoimmune process seen in RA. Therefore, if a person has post-dysenteric reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot, they may definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of knee joint,4324765,False,"No

Rationale: Arthropathy of the knee joint is a general term that refers to any disease or abnormality affecting the knee joint. While rheumatoid arthritis can certainly affect the knee joint, arthropathy of the knee joint is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. There are many other conditions that can cause arthropathy of the knee joint, such as osteoarthritis, gout, or injury. Therefore, having arthropathy of the knee joint does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Bone cyst of hand,35624896,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While it can affect the hands, a bone cyst of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A bone cyst is a benign lesion that can occur in various locations and is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having a bone cyst of the hand does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Climacteric arthritis of the hand,81376,True,"Yes, climacteric arthritis of the hand is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Climacteric arthritis of the hand refers to arthritis that occurs during the climacteric period, which is the period of transition leading to menopause in women. In the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis, joint involvement in the hands is a common feature, particularly affecting the small joints of the hands. Therefore, if a patient has climacteric arthritis of the hand, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis, as this condition is specific to RA due to the characteristic joint involvement and symptoms associated with the disease."
Lateral epicondylitis,81379,False,"No

Rationale: Lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, is a condition characterized by pain and inflammation of the tendons on the outer side of the elbow. While it can cause joint pain and discomfort, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Lateral epicondylitis is typically caused by overuse or repetitive strain injury, rather than being an autoimmune disorder like RA. Therefore, having lateral epicondylitis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Hairy malformation of palms and soles,4343207,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Hairy malformation of palms and soles"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with hairy malformations on the palms and soles. This condition may be indicative of a different underlying issue, such as a genetic disorder or hormonal imbalance. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Anemia,439777,False,"No, anemia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Anemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. While anemia can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to chronic inflammation and medication side effects, it is not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having anemia does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."

RAS-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disease,37109702,True,"Yes, the condition ""RAS-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disease"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

RAS-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disease is a rare autoimmune disorder that has been reported in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is characterized by lymphoproliferation, autoimmune cytopenias, and autoimmune manifestations. Therefore, if a patient has RAS-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disease, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Partial failure replanted finger,4308400,False,"No, a partial failure of a replanted finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition refers to a specific event or outcome related to a finger replantation surgery, where the replanted finger may not fully regain function or viability. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint deformities and functional impairment, a partial failure of a replanted finger is not a defining characteristic of the disease."
Abduction deformity of finger,4347312,True,"Yes, abduction deformity of the finger is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction can lead to deformities and functional impairment, including abduction deformity of the fingers. This deformity is a common manifestation of RA due to the chronic inflammation and joint damage characteristic of the disease. Therefore, if a patient presents with abduction deformity of the finger, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Idiopathic polyarthritis,4195770,True,"Yes, idiopathic polyarthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Idiopathic polyarthritis refers to inflammation in multiple joints of unknown cause, which is a hallmark feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, patients typically present with symmetric polyarthritis involving multiple joints, which aligns with the description of idiopathic polyarthritis. Additionally, the clinical criteria for diagnosing RA include joint involvement, which is also a key feature of idiopathic polyarthritis. Therefore, if a patient has idiopathic polyarthritis, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendonitis of left patellar tendon,765424,False,"No

Rationale: Tendonitis of the left patellar tendon is a condition involving inflammation of the patellar tendon, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with RA may develop tendonitis as a secondary complication, having tendonitis of the left patellar tendon does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. RA is primarily characterized by symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, along with specific serological markers and imaging findings."
Fibrosis of lung,4197819,False,"No, fibrosis of the lung is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While lung involvement can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, fibrosis of the lung is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Fibrosis of the lung can be caused by various factors such as environmental exposures, autoimmune diseases, and other conditions unrelated to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having fibrosis of the lung does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection,40488855,False,"No, the condition ""Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions involve autoimmune processes, they affect different systems in the body. The condition mentioned primarily affects the neuropsychiatric system, causing symptoms such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), tics, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms following a streptococcal infection. In contrast, Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having the condition mentioned does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Capsulitis of metatarsophalangeal joint of left foot,761355,False,"No

Rationale: Capsulitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot is a specific condition affecting the joint in the foot, which is not directly related to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of RA, the specific condition of capsulitis in the left foot is not a defining characteristic of RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly in the hands and feet, but capsulitis is a separate condition that may have different underlying causes. Therefore, having capsulitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovitis of joint of left knee,761354,True,"Yes, synovitis of the joint of the left knee is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis, which is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, is a common feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is a key component of the disease process, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient presents with synovitis of the joint of the left knee, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as a potential underlying cause."
Seronegative arthritis of joint of spine,40479848,True,"Yes, the condition ""Seronegative arthritis of joint of spine"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, including the spine. The term ""seronegative arthritis"" refers to a type of arthritis where the patient tests negative for rheumatoid factor, which is a common serological marker for RA. However, it is important to note that around 20-30% of patients with RA are seronegative, meaning they do not test positive for rheumatoid factor. 

Given that the condition specifically mentions arthritis of the spine, which is a common manifestation of RA, and the fact that some patients with RA are seronegative, it is reasonable to conclude that if a patient has seronegative arthritis of the joint of the spine, they may have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovitis of joint of right knee,761353,True,"Yes, synovitis of the joint of the right knee can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis, which is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, is a common feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is typically symmetric and affects multiple joints, including the knees. Therefore, if a patient presents with synovitis of the right knee, it could be indicative of RA, especially if they have other symptoms such as morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling in other joints. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of synovitis, such as infection or other types of arthritis, before definitively diagnosing RA."
Chronic primary gouty arthritis,36715572,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic primary gouty arthritis is a distinct condition from rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of acute joint inflammation due to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints. It typically affects the big toe but can also involve other joints. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having chronic primary gouty arthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Capsulitis of right ankle,761358,False,"No

Rationale:
Capsulitis of the right ankle is a condition characterized by inflammation of the joint capsule in the ankle. While joint inflammation is a common feature of rheumatoid arthritis, the specific location of the inflammation in this case (right ankle) does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects multiple joints symmetrically, with a preference for the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, the presence of capsulitis of the right ankle alone is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Capsulitis of metatarsophalangeal joint of right foot,761357,False,"No

Rationale: Capsulitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the right foot is a specific condition affecting the joint in the foot, and it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint pain and swelling can be symptoms of both conditions, capsulitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint is not a defining characteristic of RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly in the hands and feet, and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint destruction, and deformities. Therefore, having capsulitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the right foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of multiple joints associated with a neurological disorder,4322887,False,"No, the condition ""Arthropathy of multiple joints associated with a neurological disorder"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the presence of a neurological disorder in conjunction with arthropathy of multiple joints suggests a different underlying cause. This condition may be more indicative of a neurological disorder such as Charcot arthropathy, which is characterized by joint destruction due to loss of sensation and proprioception. Therefore, the presence of a neurological disorder in this context does not definitively point to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Capsulitis of left ankle,761356,False,"No, capsulitis of the left ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Capsulitis is an inflammation of the joint capsule, which can occur in any joint in the body, including the ankle. While joint inflammation is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, capsulitis of the left ankle can be caused by various other conditions such as trauma, overuse, or infection. Therefore, having capsulitis of the left ankle does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Iliohypogastric nerve neuritis,4322891,False,"No, iliohypogastric nerve neuritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Iliohypogastric nerve neuritis refers to inflammation of the iliohypogastric nerve, which can cause pain, numbness, or tingling in the lower abdomen and groin area. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can present with various symptoms, including joint pain and swelling, iliohypogastric nerve neuritis is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having iliohypogastric nerve neuritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Porokeratosis plantaris palmaris et disseminata,37397553,False,"No

Rationale: Porokeratosis plantaris palmaris et disseminata is a rare skin condition characterized by the development of multiple, small, raised, reddish-brown papules with a central depression on the palms, soles, and other parts of the body. This condition is a dermatological disorder and is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the joints. While some autoimmune diseases may have skin manifestations, porokeratosis plantaris palmaris et disseminata is not a known symptom or sign of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Climacteric arthritis of spine,4179506,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Climacteric arthritis of the spine, on the other hand, refers to degenerative changes in the spine that occur during the climacteric period (menopause). While both conditions involve joint-related issues, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes and characteristics. Therefore, having climacteric arthritis of the spine does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Epicondylitis,4249170,False,"No

Rationale:
Epicondylitis, specifically lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) or medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow), is a condition characterized by pain and inflammation at the tendinous attachment of the forearm muscles to the epicondyles of the humerus. While epicondylitis can cause joint pain and discomfort, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Epicondylitis is typically caused by repetitive strain or overuse of the forearm muscles, rather than being an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA. Therefore, having epicondylitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of the ankle and/or foot,4116008,False,"No

Rationale:
Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While gouty arthritis can affect the ankle and foot joints, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Gouty arthritis is caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having gouty arthritis of the ankle and/or foot does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Gouty arthritis of the shoulder region,4116007,False,"No

Rationale: Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. While gout can affect various joints in the body, it typically presents in the lower extremities, particularly the big toe. In contrast, Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet, and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, gouty arthritis of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infection causing spondyloarthritis,36715561,False,"No

Rationale: While infection can cause spondyloarthritis, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Spondyloarthritis is a group of inflammatory diseases that includes ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and enteropathic arthritis. These conditions are characterized by inflammation primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, rather than the symmetric polyarthritis seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having an infection causing spondyloarthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of shoulder region,37311520,False,"No, tendinitis of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tendinitis is inflammation or irritation of a tendon, which can occur in various parts of the body including the shoulder. While joint pain and inflammation are common symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis, tendinitis of the shoulder region can be caused by various factors such as overuse, injury, or underlying conditions like osteoarthritis. Therefore, having tendinitis of the shoulder region does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of first metatarsophalangeal joint of right foot,761361,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of first metatarsophalangeal joint of right foot"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement typically affects the small joints of the hands and feet, including the metatarsophalangeal joints. The presence of arthritis in this specific joint, especially in combination with other symptoms such as morning stiffness and joint swelling, would strongly suggest a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,45763750,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and progressive lung disease characterized by scarring of the lung tissue, leading to difficulty breathing and decreased lung function. While there have been some associations between rheumatoid arthritis and interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Migratory polyarthritis,4009504,True,"Yes, migratory polyarthritis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Migratory polyarthritis refers to the pattern of joint involvement where joint pain and swelling move from one joint to another over time. This is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, where multiple joints are affected symmetrically. Additionally, migratory polyarthritis is one of the clinical criteria used in the diagnosis of RA. Therefore, if a patient presents with migratory polyarthritis, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Open fracture of medial plateau of right tibia,37209129,False,"No, an open fracture of the medial plateau of the right tibia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. An open fracture is a traumatic injury involving a break in the bone that penetrates through the skin, which is not a characteristic feature of RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder, whereas an open fracture is a result of physical trauma to the bone. While a person with RA may potentially experience a fracture due to weakened bones from long-term inflammation, the presence of an open fracture of the tibia does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Periarthritis of wrist,4009506,False,"No, periarthritis of the wrist is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Periarthritis of the wrist refers to inflammation of the tissues surrounding the wrist joint, which can be caused by various factors such as overuse, injury, or inflammatory conditions like arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect the wrist joints, periarthritis of the wrist is a more general term that can be seen in other conditions as well. Therefore, having periarthritis of the wrist does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Villonodular synovitis of sternoclavicular joint,4116001,False,"No

Rationale:
Villonodular synovitis of the sternoclavicular joint is a rare benign proliferative disorder of the synovium that can cause pain, swelling, and limited range of motion in the affected joint. While it can present with symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. Villonodular synovitis is a distinct condition that is not necessarily indicative of RA. Therefore, having villonodular synovitis of the sternoclavicular joint does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Open fracture of lateral plateau of right tibia,37209128,False,"No

Rationale: An open fracture of the lateral plateau of the right tibia is a specific injury involving a fracture of the bone. While this condition may lead to inflammation and joint damage in the affected area, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and an open fracture is a traumatic injury to the bone. While a person with rheumatoid arthritis may potentially experience complications such as fractures due to joint damage, having an open fracture of the lateral plateau of the right tibia does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Ross River disease,37311514,False,"No, Ross River disease is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ross River disease is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, causing symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, as well as fever, rash, and fatigue. While joint symptoms are present in both conditions, Ross River disease is caused by a virus and is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having Ross River disease does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Derangement of left knee,37108752,False,"No, a derangement of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a key feature of RA, derangement of the left knee could be caused by a variety of conditions such as ligament tears, meniscal injuries, or osteoarthritis. To definitively diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis, additional criteria such as serological markers and imaging findings would need to be considered in addition to joint symptoms."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of foot,36674568,False,"No, a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While nodules can be a feature of RA, they are not exclusive to this condition and can be present in other diseases such as gout or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the foot does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Derangement of right knee,37108753,False,"No, a derangement of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of RA, a derangement of the right knee could be caused by a variety of conditions such as ligament tears, meniscus injuries, or osteoarthritis. To definitively diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis, additional criteria such as serological markers and imaging findings would need to be considered in addition to joint symptoms."
Nodule of subcutaneous tissue of lower limb,36674567,False,"No

Rationale: While nodules of subcutaneous tissue can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, they are not specific to this condition. Nodules can also be present in other conditions such as gout, granuloma annulare, or even as a result of trauma. Therefore, the presence of a nodule of subcutaneous tissue of the lower limb does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Defect of skin of hand,46273771,False,"No, a defect of the skin of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, it does not typically present with skin defects on the hand. Skin defects could be indicative of other conditions such as dermatitis, eczema, or trauma, but they are not a defining characteristic of RA."
Open fracture of condyle of left femur,37209116,False,"No, an open fracture of the condyle of the left femur is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. An open fracture is a traumatic injury to the bone, typically caused by a significant force or impact. In this case, the fracture is specifically located in the condyle of the left femur, which is a specific anatomical location. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, not a traumatic injury to a specific bone. Therefore, having an open fracture of the condyle of the left femur does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Open fracture of condyle of right femur,37209115,False,"No, an open fracture of the condyle of the right femur is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. An open fracture of the condyle of the right femur is a traumatic injury involving a break in the bone, specifically the condyle of the femur. This condition is not related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that characterizes Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially experience fractures due to weakened bones from the disease, an open fracture of the condyle of the right femur is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendonitis of right ankle,761382,False,"No.

Rationale: Tendonitis of the right ankle is a condition that involves inflammation of the tendons in the ankle joint. While it may cause pain and swelling in the affected area, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Tendonitis of the right ankle is a localized condition that does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA."
Fracture of acromial process of scapula,4337263,False,"No, a fracture of the acromial process of the scapula is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A fracture is a physical injury to the bone, typically caused by trauma or excessive force. In the case of a fracture of the acromial process of the scapula, it is a result of direct trauma to the shoulder area. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may be at a higher risk for fractures due to joint damage and osteoporosis, a fracture of the acromial process of the scapula is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendonitis of left ankle,761381,False,"No, tendonitis of the left ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tendonitis is inflammation of a tendon, which can occur due to overuse, injury, or other factors. While joint pain and swelling can be symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis, tendonitis of the left ankle is a specific localized condition that can have various causes unrelated to RA. It is important to consider other factors and symptoms when diagnosing Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finding of hand region,77358,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Finding of hand region"" is a very general term that does not specifically point to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While hand involvement is common in Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not exclusive to this condition and can be seen in other types of arthritis as well. Therefore, having a finding of hand region does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Injury of finger,81454,False,"No, an injury of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling in the small joints of the hands, an injury of the finger can occur in anyone regardless of whether they have RA or not. Injuries can result from trauma, accidents, or overuse, and do not necessarily indicate the presence of RA."
Disorder of digit,4029964,True,"Yes, a disorder of digit can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement often starts in the small joints of the hands and feet, leading to symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and deformities. Therefore, if a person has a disorder of digit, particularly in the context of joint pain and swelling, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of a disorder of digit, such as trauma or other forms of arthritis, before making a definitive diagnosis of RA."
Finding of joint of toe,4101641,False,"No, the condition ""Finding of joint of toe"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of RA, finding a joint of the toe alone is not sufficient to definitively diagnose RA. RA typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, including the small joints of the hands and feet. Additionally, other conditions such as osteoarthritis or gout can also present with joint involvement in the toe. Further evaluation, including clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings, would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Non-traumatic rupture of tendon of right patella,761395,False,"No, a non-traumatic rupture of the tendon of the right patella is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of RA, a tendon rupture is not a typical manifestation of the disease. Tendon ruptures can occur due to various reasons such as trauma, overuse, or underlying conditions like tendinopathy, but they are not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having a non-traumatic rupture of the tendon of the right patella does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of finger of left hand,37108750,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of finger of left hand"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. In the description of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is mentioned that the disease often presents with joint pain and swelling, particularly in the small joints of the hands. Therefore, if a person has arthritis in the finger of their left hand, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis of gingiva,4122119,False,"No

Rationale:
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a systemic autoimmune vasculitis that primarily affects the respiratory tract and kidneys. While GPA can involve the oral cavity, including the gingiva, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having granulomatosis with polyangiitis of the gingiva does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of finger of right hand,37108751,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of finger of right hand"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric, and arthritis in the fingers, particularly the small joints of the hands, is a common presentation. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are consistent with arthritis in the finger joints. Therefore, if a person has arthritis in the finger of their right hand, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Open fracture of lateral plateau of left tibia,37209097,False,"No

Rationale: An open fracture of the lateral plateau of the left tibia is a specific injury involving a fracture of the bone. While this condition may lead to complications such as infection or arthritis in the affected joint, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and an open fracture is a traumatic injury to the bone. While a person with an open fracture may develop arthritis in the affected joint over time, having an open fracture does not definitively mean that the individual has rheumatoid arthritis."
Bilateral hemarthrosis of knee joints,36686959,True,"Yes, bilateral hemarthrosis of knee joints can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hemarthrosis, which is bleeding into a joint, can occur in patients with RA due to inflammation and damage to the synovial lining of the joints. In RA, the chronic inflammation can lead to joint swelling, pain, and ultimately bleeding into the joint space. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral hemarthrosis of knee joints, it could be a strong indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pneumonitis,253506,False,"No, pneumonitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pneumonitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of the lung tissue, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, exposure to toxins, radiation therapy, or autoimmune diseases. While patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop interstitial lung disease, which can present as pneumonitis, pneumonitis itself is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having pneumonitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral effusion of joints of knees,36686955,True,"Yes, bilateral effusion of joints of knees is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Effusion of the knee joints is a common finding in Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is characterized by inflammation of the synovial lining of the joints. Bilateral effusion, meaning fluid accumulation in both knee joints, is a common presentation in RA due to the systemic nature of the disease affecting multiple joints symmetrically. This symptom, along with other clinical criteria such as joint involvement and serological markers, can help in the diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral effusion of knee joints, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Crystal arthropathy of ankle AND/OR foot,73287,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While RA can affect any joint in the body, it typically presents with symptoms in the small joints of the hands and feet. Crystal arthropathy, on the other hand, refers to a group of conditions caused by the deposition of crystals in the joints, such as gout or pseudogout. While both conditions can affect the ankle and foot joints, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having crystal arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Palindromic rheumatism of ankle and/or foot,73291,True,"Yes, the condition ""Palindromic rheumatism of ankle and/or foot"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Palindromic rheumatism is a rare form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent episodes of joint pain, swelling, and stiffness that resolve spontaneously within a few days. It is considered a precursor to RA in some cases, as some patients with palindromic rheumatism may go on to develop RA. Additionally, the involvement of the ankle and/or foot joints in palindromic rheumatism is consistent with the pattern of joint involvement seen in RA, particularly in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, if a patient has palindromic rheumatism of the ankle and/or foot, they may be at risk for developing RA in the future."
Thrombophlebitis of upper extremities,319054,False,"No, thrombophlebitis of upper extremities is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Thrombophlebitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of a vein with blood clot formation. While it can occur in patients with RA due to the chronic inflammatory state associated with the disease, it is not a defining feature of RA. Thrombophlebitis can also occur in individuals without RA due to various other factors such as trauma, surgery, or underlying medical conditions. Therefore, having thrombophlebitis of the upper extremities does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis of larynx,4048502,True,"Yes, the condition ""Granulomatosis with polyangiitis of larynx"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a systemic autoimmune vasculitis that primarily affects the respiratory tract and kidneys. While GPA and RA are both autoimmune diseases, they are distinct entities with different clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having granulomatosis with polyangiitis of the larynx does not necessarily mean that a person also has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Climacteric arthritis of the ankle and/or foot,75341,False,"No

Rationale: Climacteric arthritis of the ankle and/or foot is a specific condition that refers to arthritis affecting the ankle and/or foot during the climacteric period (menopause). While rheumatoid arthritis can affect any joint in the body, it is not specifically associated with the climacteric period. Therefore, having climacteric arthritis of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Furuncle of groin,4071026,False,"No

Rationale: A furuncle of the groin, also known as a boil, is a localized infection of a hair follicle or sweat gland. While it is possible for a person with rheumatoid arthritis to develop a furuncle of the groin due to a weakened immune system, the presence of a furuncle of the groin does not specifically indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having a furuncle of the groin does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Dislocation of sternoclavicular joint,4136562,False,"No

Rationale:
Dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a characteristic feature of RA, dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint is not a common presentation of the disease. Dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint is typically caused by trauma or injury to the joint, rather than being a direct result of RA. Therefore, having a dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hemarthrosis of shoulder region,75345,False,"No

Rationale: Hemarthrosis of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hemarthrosis refers to bleeding into a joint cavity, which can occur in various conditions such as trauma, hemophilia, or other inflammatory joint diseases. While hemarthrosis can be seen in some cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint inflammation and damage, it is not a specific indicator of this particular malady."
Synovitis/tenosynovitis - wrist,73301,True,"Yes, synovitis/tenosynovitis in the wrist is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, synovitis is a key feature, characterized by inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints. This inflammation can lead to tenosynovitis, which is inflammation of the tendon sheaths. In RA, synovitis/tenosynovitis in the wrist is a common manifestation, often leading to joint swelling, pain, and stiffness in the affected area. Therefore, if a patient presents with synovitis/tenosynovitis in the wrist, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause."
Radial styloid tenosynovitis,73300,False,"No

Rationale: Radial styloid tenosynovitis is a condition involving inflammation of the tendons surrounding the radial styloid process at the wrist. While this condition can cause wrist pain and swelling, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Radial styloid tenosynovitis can occur in various conditions, including overuse injuries or repetitive strain, and is not a defining feature of rheumatoid arthritis."
Acute lymphangitis of shoulder,4175465,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute lymphangitis of the shoulder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acute lymphangitis is an infection of the lymphatic vessels, typically caused by bacteria entering through a break in the skin. It is characterized by red streaks on the skin, swelling, and tenderness along the affected lymphatic vessels. This condition is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop acute lymphangitis of the shoulder as a separate issue, the presence of acute lymphangitis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Finger clubbing,134746,False,"No

Rationale: Finger clubbing is a physical sign characterized by enlargement of the fingertips and nails, resulting in a bulbous appearance. While finger clubbing can be associated with various medical conditions, including respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, the presence of finger clubbing does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Degenerative polyarthritis,4025957,False,"No, degenerative polyarthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Degenerative polyarthritis refers to a type of arthritis that is primarily due to wear and tear on the joints, leading to degeneration of the joint cartilage and bone. This is different from Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. While both conditions may present with joint pain and swelling, the underlying mechanisms and treatment approaches are different. Therefore, having degenerative polyarthritis does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tuberculosis of vertebral column,81496,False,"No

Rationale: Tuberculosis of the vertebral column is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the musculoskeletal system, they are distinct entities with different etiologies, pathophysiology, and clinical presentations. Tuberculosis of the vertebral column is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, leading to destruction of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having tuberculosis of the vertebral column does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of sacrum,138841,False,"No, a disorder of the sacrum is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not specifically target the sacrum. A disorder of the sacrum could be related to various other conditions such as sacroiliitis, sacral fractures, or sacral tumors, which are not exclusive to RA. Therefore, having a disorder of the sacrum does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Erythema multiforme,132702,False,"No, erythema multiforme is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Erythema multiforme is a skin condition characterized by target-like lesions on the skin, often triggered by infections or medications. It is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory joint disorder that is rheumatoid arthritis. While some autoimmune conditions may coexist, the presence of erythema multiforme does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Calcific tendinitis of shoulder,441946,False,"No

Rationale:
Calcific tendinitis of the shoulder is a condition characterized by the formation of calcium deposits within the tendons of the shoulder, leading to pain and limited range of motion. While calcific tendinitis of the shoulder can cause symptoms such as shoulder pain and stiffness, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and destruction. Therefore, having calcific tendinitis of the shoulder does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Disorder of nail,132706,False,"No

Rationale: A disorder of the nail is a very nonspecific symptom that can be seen in a variety of conditions, not just Rheumatoid Arthritis. While changes in the nails, such as pitting or discoloration, can sometimes be seen in patients with RA, it is not a specific enough symptom to definitively diagnose the malady. Therefore, having a disorder of the nail does not necessarily mean that a person definitely has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Eczema of wrist,4114013,False,"No

Rationale: Eczema of the wrist is a skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin on the wrist area. While it is possible for individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis to also have eczema, eczema of the wrist is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Eczema is a common skin condition that can occur in individuals without Rheumatoid Arthritis, so having eczema of the wrist does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Barber's pilonidal sinus,4101714,False,"No

Rationale:
Barber's pilonidal sinus is a condition characterized by the formation of a cyst or abscess in the sacrococcygeal area, typically occurring in young males. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as the two conditions affect different parts of the body and have different etiologies. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, while Barber's pilonidal sinus affects the sacrococcygeal area. Therefore, having Barber's pilonidal sinus does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of connective tissue,253549,False,"No, a disorder of connective tissue is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints, a disorder of connective tissue can encompass a wide range of conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, having a disorder of connective tissue does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Spindling of finger,4093520,True,"Yes, spindling of the finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Spindling of the fingers, also known as ""ulnar deviation,"" is a characteristic deformity seen in patients with advanced Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is caused by chronic inflammation and destruction of the joints in the hands, leading to the fingers deviating towards the ulnar side. Therefore, if a patient presents with spindling of the fingers, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of wrist,40483847,False,"No, infective arthritis of the wrist is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is a bacterial infection of a joint that can affect any joint in the body, including the wrist. It is characterized by joint pain, swelling, redness, and limited range of motion. The presence of a bacterial infection differentiates infective arthritis from autoimmune conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints due to autoimmune inflammation, infective arthritis of the wrist is caused by a bacterial infection and requires prompt treatment with antibiotics. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the wrist does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Derangement of lateral meniscus of right knee,765562,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition of derangement of the lateral meniscus of the right knee is specific to an injury or issue with the meniscus in the knee joint, which is not a characteristic symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling, the specific condition of derangement of the lateral meniscus is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder."
Pachydermodactyly,4081231,False,"No, pachydermodactyly is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pachydermodactyly is a rare benign condition characterized by painless soft tissue swelling of the fingers, typically affecting young males. It is not associated with autoimmune inflammation of the joints like Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having pachydermodactyly does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Derangement of lateral meniscus of left knee,765561,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Derangement of lateral meniscus of left knee"" is specific to a problem with the meniscus in the knee joint, which is not a characteristic symptom or feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). While individuals with RA may experience joint pain and swelling, these symptoms are not specific to a meniscus derangement. Therefore, having a derangement of the lateral meniscus of the left knee does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acquired genu valgum of bilateral knees,761471,False,"No, acquired genu valgum of bilateral knees is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Genu valgum, also known as knock knees, is a condition where the knees angle in and touch each other when the legs are straightened. It can be caused by a variety of factors such as genetics, obesity, or previous injury. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect the joints, including the knees, genu valgum is not a specific symptom or characteristic of RA. Therefore, having acquired genu valgum of bilateral knees does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic osteomyelitis of hip,4122186,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic osteomyelitis of the hip is a condition characterized by a persistent infection of the bone, typically caused by bacteria. While chronic osteomyelitis can cause joint pain and inflammation, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas osteomyelitis is a bone infection. Therefore, having chronic osteomyelitis of the hip does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Spondyloarthritis,37205058,False,"No, spondyloarthritis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Spondyloarthritis is a group of inflammatory diseases that primarily affect the spine and sacroiliac joints, including conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and enteropathic arthritis. While some symptoms of spondyloarthritis may overlap with rheumatoid arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having spondyloarthritis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Pustular psoriasis of palm of hand,37205057,False,"No.

Rationale:
Pustular psoriasis of the palm of the hand is a skin condition characterized by the presence of pustules on the palms. While rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, there is no direct correlation between pustular psoriasis of the palm of the hand and rheumatoid arthritis. Although some patients with rheumatoid arthritis may also have psoriasis, the presence of pustular psoriasis of the palm of the hand alone does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Pustular psoriasis of sole of foot,37205056,False,"No, pustular psoriasis of the sole of the foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pustular psoriasis is a skin condition characterized by pus-filled blisters on the skin, typically on the hands and feet. While some patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have psoriasis, the presence of pustular psoriasis on the sole of the foot does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other factors such as joint involvement, serological markers, and imaging findings to diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovitis/tenosynovitis - hip,4122178,True,"Yes, synovitis/tenosynovitis in the hip can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, synovitis is a key feature, as it is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. Synovitis in the hip joint can be a manifestation of RA, as it is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Additionally, RA often presents with morning stiffness and joint pain, which can also be associated with synovitis/tenosynovitis in the hip. Therefore, if a patient has synovitis/tenosynovitis in the hip, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovitis/tenosynovitis - knee,4122179,True,"Yes, synovitis/tenosynovitis in the knee is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Synovitis is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, which is a hallmark feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tenosynovitis is inflammation of the tendon sheath, which can also occur in RA due to the inflammatory process affecting the surrounding structures. Therefore, the presence of synovitis/tenosynovitis in the knee is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a common manifestation of the disease."
Bilateral disorder of patellofemoral joints,36686930,False,"No.

Rationale: A bilateral disorder of the patellofemoral joints is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a key feature of RA, the specific mention of a bilateral disorder of the patellofemoral joints does not definitively point to RA. This condition could be seen in other types of arthritis or joint disorders as well. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic bucket handle tear of medial meniscus of right knee,761483,False,"No

Rationale: A chronic bucket handle tear of the medial meniscus of the right knee is a specific condition related to a tear in the knee cartilage. While this condition may cause symptoms such as knee pain and swelling, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and deformities. Therefore, having a chronic bucket handle tear of the medial meniscus of the right knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cellulitis of hand,4267714,False,"No

Rationale: Cellulitis of the hand is a bacterial skin infection that can cause redness, swelling, and warmth in the affected area. While it is possible for someone with rheumatoid arthritis to develop cellulitis of the hand, having cellulitis of the hand does not definitively mean that someone has rheumatoid arthritis. Cellulitis is a separate condition that can occur in individuals with or without rheumatoid arthritis."
Anti-glomerular basement membrane tubulointerstitial nephritis,4267717,False,"No, the condition ""Anti-glomerular basement membrane tubulointerstitial nephritis"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition is actually associated with a different autoimmune disorder called Goodpasture syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies attacking the kidneys and lungs. While Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder, it primarily affects the joints and is not typically associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane tubulointerstitial nephritis."
Chronic bucket handle tear of lateral meniscus of right knee,761486,False,"No, a chronic bucket handle tear of the lateral meniscus of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

A bucket handle tear of the meniscus is a specific injury to the knee joint, typically caused by trauma or degenerative changes. It is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop secondary knee issues, such as meniscal tears, the presence of a chronic bucket handle tear of the lateral meniscus of the right knee does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Semimembranosus tendinitis,4001467,False,"No

Rationale: Semimembranosus tendinitis is a condition involving inflammation of the semimembranosus tendon, which is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. While joint pain and inflammation are common symptoms in both conditions, semimembranosus tendinitis is a localized issue affecting a specific tendon, whereas rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting multiple joints. Therefore, having semimembranosus tendinitis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Chronic bucket handle tear of medial meniscus of left knee,761484,False,"No, a chronic bucket handle tear of the medial meniscus of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

A bucket handle tear of the meniscus is a specific injury to the knee joint, typically caused by trauma or degenerative changes. It is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop secondary knee issues, such as meniscal tears, the presence of a chronic bucket handle tear of the medial meniscus of the left knee does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cervical arthritis,4300489,False,"No, cervical arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Cervical arthritis refers to arthritis affecting the cervical spine, specifically the vertebrae in the neck. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the hands and feet, it can also affect the cervical spine. However, cervical arthritis can be caused by various other conditions such as osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, or injury. Therefore, having cervical arthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Coracoid impingement,4001462,False,"No, coracoid impingement is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Coracoid impingement is a condition where the coracoid process of the scapula impinges on surrounding structures, typically causing shoulder pain and limited range of motion. While shoulder pain can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, coracoid impingement is not a defining characteristic of RA. Therefore, having coracoid impingement does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hemarthrosis of left knee,37117114,True,"Yes, hemarthrosis of the left knee can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Hemarthrosis, which is bleeding into a joint, can occur in patients with RA due to inflammation and damage to the synovial lining of the joint. In RA, the chronic inflammation can lead to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which can result in bleeding into the joint space. Therefore, if a patient with RA presents with hemarthrosis of the left knee, it is likely specific to their underlying condition."
Synovitis of joint of foot,37205178,True,"Yes, synovitis of the joint of the foot is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, which is a characteristic feature of RA. In RA, synovitis leads to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. Therefore, if a patient has synovitis of the joint of the foot, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Synovitis of ankle joint,37205177,True,"Yes, synovitis of the ankle joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Synovitis is inflammation of the synovial membrane lining the joints, which is a characteristic feature of RA. In RA, synovitis is a key component of the disease process, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient has synovitis of the ankle joint, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause."
Acute rheumatic endocarditis,437897,False,"No.

Rationale:
Acute rheumatic endocarditis is a condition that involves inflammation of the heart valves due to a complication of rheumatic fever, not rheumatoid arthritis. While both conditions involve inflammation, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes and manifestations. Therefore, having acute rheumatic endocarditis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Charcot arthropathy of joint of ankle,45763637,False,"No.

Rationale:
Charcot arthropathy of the joint of the ankle is a condition characterized by progressive destruction of a weight-bearing joint, typically due to underlying neuropathy. While this condition can lead to joint deformities and functional impairment similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is not specific to RA. Charcot arthropathy is often associated with conditions such as diabetes mellitus, syphilis, and other neuropathic disorders, rather than autoimmune inflammatory disorders like RA. Therefore, having Charcot arthropathy of the joint of the ankle does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Sacroiliac disorder,4001453,False,"No, sacroiliac disorder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Sacroiliac disorder refers to dysfunction or pain in the sacroiliac joint, which is located in the pelvis and connects the sacrum to the ilium. While sacroiliac disorder can cause symptoms such as lower back pain, it is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, particularly in the hands and feet, and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having a sacroiliac disorder does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of joint of left ankle,761503,True,"Yes, the condition ""Disorder of joint of left ankle"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is a key feature, and it commonly affects the small joints of the hands and feet. The left ankle is a joint commonly affected by RA, so if a person has a disorder of the joint of the left ankle, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are symptoms that could manifest in the left ankle in this case."
Arthropathy of left elbow,761502,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the left elbow can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the elbows. The presence of arthropathy in the left elbow could be indicative of RA, especially if there are other signs and symptoms consistent with the disease, such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of arthropathy in the left elbow, such as trauma or other forms of arthritis, before definitively linking it to RA."
Bursitis of upper limb,46273620,False,"No.

Rationale:
Bursitis of the upper limb is a condition characterized by inflammation of the bursae, which are small fluid-filled sacs that cushion the bones, tendons, and muscles near joints. While bursitis can cause pain, swelling, and limited range of motion in the affected area, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Bursitis can occur in various joints of the upper limb, including the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, and can be caused by repetitive movements, trauma, or underlying conditions such as arthritis. Therefore, having bursitis of the upper limb does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthrofibrosis of left knee,37117089,False,"No

Rationale:
Arthrofibrosis of the left knee is a condition characterized by excessive scar tissue formation within the knee joint, leading to stiffness and limited range of motion. While arthrofibrosis can occur as a complication of various knee surgeries or injuries, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having arthrofibrosis of the left knee does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Contracture of joint of finger of left hand due to scar,761491,False,"No

Rationale: Contracture of a joint of the finger due to scar is a specific physical finding related to scarring and tissue damage, rather than a symptom or sign specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint deformities and functional impairment are common in RA, contractures due to scarring are not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having a contracture of a joint of the finger of the left hand due to scar does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of joint of finger of right hand due to scar,761490,False,"No, contracture of joint of finger of right hand due to scar is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Contracture of a joint due to scar tissue is a physical limitation of movement caused by the formation of scar tissue, which is not a characteristic feature of RA. While RA can lead to joint deformities and functional impairment, contractures due to scar tissue are not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having a contracture of a joint of the finger of the right hand due to scar does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral acquired varus deformity of knees,36687030,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral acquired varus deformity of knees is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is known to cause joint deformities, including varus deformities of the knees. The chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints in RA can lead to changes in joint alignment and structure, resulting in deformities such as varus deformity. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral acquired varus deformity of the knees, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis as the underlying cause."
Chronic disruption of cruciate ligament of right knee,761489,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic disruption of the cruciate ligament of the right knee is a specific condition related to a knee injury, not a symptom or sign specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling, the chronic disruption of the cruciate ligament is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Chronic disruption of cruciate ligament of left knee,761488,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic disruption of the cruciate ligament of the left knee is a specific condition related to the knee joint, which is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a key feature of RA, the specific condition mentioned does not directly correlate with the autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having chronic disruption of the cruciate ligament of the left knee does not definitively mean that an individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary ITP (immune thrombocytopenia),4028065,False,"No, Primary ITP (immune thrombocytopenia) is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While there have been some reported cases of an association between ITP and RA, having Primary ITP does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. Primary ITP is a condition characterized by a low platelet count due to immune-mediated destruction of platelets, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. The two conditions have different pathophysiologies and clinical presentations."
Synovial plica syndrome of bilateral knees,761493,False,"No

Rationale: Synovial plica syndrome of bilateral knees is a condition that involves irritation or inflammation of the synovial plica in the knee joint, which can cause pain, clicking, or catching in the knee. While this condition may cause symptoms similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. RA is a systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the synovial joints, leading to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The presence of synovial plica syndrome of bilateral knees does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Total failure replanted hand,4308703,False,"No, the condition ""total failure replanted hand"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described does not align with the typical symptoms or characteristics of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is more likely related to a traumatic injury or surgical complication rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Onychia of finger,444057,False,"No, onychia of the finger is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Onychia is an inflammation of the nail matrix or nail bed, which can be caused by various factors such as trauma, infection, or underlying skin conditions. While joint involvement is common in Rheumatoid Arthritis, onychia alone is not a specific indicator of this particular autoimmune disorder. Additional symptoms and diagnostic criteria for RA would need to be present for a definitive diagnosis."
Total failure replanted fingers,4308705,False,"No

Rationale: The condition of total failure of replanted fingers is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint deformities and functional impairment, total failure of replanted fingers is a specific event related to a surgical procedure to reattach severed fingers. This condition is not a characteristic symptom or feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Total failure replanted thumb,4308704,False,"No

Rationale: A total failure of a replanted thumb is a specific condition related to a traumatic injury or surgical complication involving the thumb. While rheumatoid arthritis can affect the joints, including those in the hands, the presence of a total failure of a replanted thumb does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having a total failure of a replanted thumb does not necessarily mean that an individual has rheumatoid arthritis."
Isolated sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis,35624123,False,"No, isolated sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Isolated sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis is a rare benign condition characterized by the abnormal growth of bone at the sternocostoclavicular junction. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions may involve joint-related symptoms, they are distinct entities with different underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having isolated sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of elbow,46273638,False,"No.

Rationale:
Primary chronic gout without tophus of elbow is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe attacks of pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of elbow does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Calcific tendinitis of bilateral hips,36686986,False,"No

Rationale: Calcific tendinitis of bilateral hips is a condition characterized by the formation of calcium deposits in the tendons around the hip joints, leading to pain and limited range of motion. While this condition may cause hip pain and discomfort, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having calcific tendinitis of bilateral hips does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Primary chronic gout without tophus of hip,46273639,False,"No

Rationale: Primary chronic gout without tophus of hip is a specific condition characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to recurrent episodes of acute arthritis. While gout can present with joint pain, swelling, and inflammation similar to RA, it is a distinct condition with a different underlying pathophysiology. Gout is caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints, whereas RA is an autoimmune disorder affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having primary chronic gout without tophus of hip does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of left hip joint,761507,False,"No, arthropathy of the left hip joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Arthropathy refers to any disease or abnormal condition affecting a joint, and it can be caused by various factors such as trauma, infection, or other types of arthritis like osteoarthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including the hips, the presence of arthropathy in the left hip joint alone does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis. Further evaluation, including clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings, would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of metatarsophalangeal joint of second toe of right foot,36686983,False,"No.

Rationale:
Tendinitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the second toe of the right foot is a specific condition related to inflammation of the tendon in that particular area. While joint pain and inflammation are common symptoms in both tendinitis and rheumatoid arthritis, the specific location and nature of the condition described do not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, and the condition described is more localized to a specific tendon in the foot. Therefore, having tendinitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the second toe of the right foot does not necessarily mean that an individual has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthropathy of right shoulder,761506,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the right shoulder can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the shoulders. The presence of arthropathy in the right shoulder could be indicative of RA, especially if there are other signs and symptoms consistent with the disease, such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. Further evaluation with serological markers and imaging studies may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RA in this case."
Ilioinguinal nerve neuritis,4323048,False,"No, ilioinguinal nerve neuritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ilioinguinal nerve neuritis refers to inflammation of the ilioinguinal nerve, which can cause pain, numbness, or tingling in the groin area. This condition is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as RA primarily affects the synovial joints with symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. While individuals with RA may experience nerve-related symptoms, ilioinguinal nerve neuritis is not a direct result of RA and can occur independently of this autoimmune disorder."
Tendinitis of metatarsophalangeal joint of second toe of left foot,36686982,False,"No.

Rationale:
Tendinitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the second toe of the left foot is a specific condition related to inflammation of the tendon in that particular area. While it may cause pain and swelling in the joint, it is not a specific symptom or diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, and the presence of tendinitis in a specific toe joint does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be necessary to diagnose RA."
Arthropathy of left shoulder,761505,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the left shoulder can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the shoulders. The presence of arthropathy in the left shoulder could be indicative of RA, especially if other joints are also affected. Additionally, RA is known to cause joint destruction and deformities, which can manifest as arthropathy in the shoulder joint. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy of the left shoulder, they may definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of joint of right ankle,761504,False,"No

Rationale: A disorder of the joint of the right ankle is a specific condition related to the right ankle joint, which may be caused by various factors such as trauma, osteoarthritis, or other inflammatory conditions. While rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, including those in the feet, hands, and other areas, the presence of a disorder in the right ankle joint alone does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis specifically in this case."
Congenital dislocation of right knee,36686979,False,"No, congenital dislocation of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Congenital dislocation of the knee is a condition present at birth where the knee joint is out of place. It is a musculoskeletal abnormality that is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that characterizes Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may also have congenital dislocation of the knee, the presence of the knee dislocation does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of right hip joint,761508,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the right hip joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the hips. The presence of arthropathy in the right hip joint could be indicative of RA, especially if other joints are also affected. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint destruction and deformities, which can occur in the hip joint as well. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy of the right hip joint, it is possible that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral arthritis of first metatarsophalangeal joints,36687007,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joints is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, which means that it affects joints on both sides of the body. The involvement of the first metatarsophalangeal joints (the joints at the base of the big toe) is a common presentation in RA. Additionally, the presence of arthritis in these specific joints, along with other clinical criteria such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness, can help support a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joints, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Sexually acquired reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot,4066956,False,"No, sexually acquired reactive arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Sexually acquired reactive arthropathy is a type of arthritis that can occur after a genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection, typically caused by bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Campylobacter. It is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and swelling, the underlying mechanisms and causes are different."
Chronic gout of knee without tophus due to renal impairment,46273648,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition described, chronic gout of the knee without tophus due to renal impairment, is specific to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. It is not a characteristic feature of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having chronic gout of the knee without tophus due to renal impairment does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Bilateral capsulitis of metatarsophalangeal joint of feet,36687004,True,"Yes, bilateral capsulitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the feet can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Capsulitis is inflammation of the joint capsule, which is a common finding in RA due to the chronic inflammatory process affecting the synovial joints. In RA, the small joints of the hands and feet are commonly affected, and bilateral involvement is also typical. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral capsulitis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the feet, it could be a specific sign of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Sexually acquired reactive arthropathy of the shoulder region,4066954,False,"No

Rationale: Sexually acquired reactive arthropathy of the shoulder region is a specific condition related to a reactive arthritis that occurs after a genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection. It is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings that differentiate it from other types of arthritis. While both conditions involve joint inflammation, they have different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria."
Chronic gout of wrist without tophus caused by drug,46273655,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic gout of the wrist without tophus caused by a drug is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe attacks of pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint diseases, they have different underlying causes, symptoms, and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having chronic gout of the wrist without tophus caused by a drug does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Staphylococcal arthritis and polyarthritis,4066952,False,"No, Staphylococcal arthritis and polyarthritis are not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Staphylococcal arthritis is caused by a bacterial infection of the joint, typically by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to joint inflammation and symptoms such as pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. Polyarthritis refers to inflammation involving multiple joints. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can present with polyarthritis, it is not specific to Staphylococcal arthritis or polyarthritis. Staphylococcal arthritis and polyarthritis can have various causes, including infections, autoimmune conditions, and other inflammatory disorders."
Disorder of free lower limb,44782620,False,"No, a disorder of the free lower limb is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a key feature of RA, the specific description of a disorder of the free lower limb is too broad and could be indicative of various other conditions or injuries unrelated to RA. Further evaluation and specific symptoms related to RA would be needed to make a definitive diagnosis."
Chronic gout of ankle and/or foot without tophus caused by drug,46273653,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic gout of the ankle and/or foot without tophus caused by drug is a specific condition related to gout, not rheumatoid arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. While both gout and rheumatoid arthritis are inflammatory joint conditions, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Therefore, having chronic gout of the ankle and/or foot without tophus caused by drug does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthropathy of right elbow,765622,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the right elbow can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the elbows. The presence of arthropathy in the right elbow could be a sign of RA, especially if there are other symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. Additionally, imaging findings such as joint erosions on X-ray can help confirm the diagnosis of RA. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy of the right elbow along with other clinical criteria for RA, it is likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acquired bilateral genu recurvatum,37209335,False,"No, acquired bilateral genu recurvatum is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Acquired bilateral genu recurvatum refers to a condition where the knees hyperextend beyond the normal range when standing. This can be caused by various factors such as muscle weakness, ligament laxity, or joint hypermobility. While it can be seen in some patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to joint deformities and laxity, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having acquired bilateral genu recurvatum does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Thrombophlebitis of lower extremities,444097,False,"No, thrombophlebitis of lower extremities is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Thrombophlebitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of a vein with the formation of a blood clot, typically in the lower extremities. While inflammation is a common feature in both conditions, thrombophlebitis is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additionally, the underlying causes and mechanisms of these two conditions are different, with Rheumatoid Arthritis being an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the joints."
Gout of vertebra due to renal impairment,46273541,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Gout, on the other hand, is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness. The condition of ""Gout of vertebra due to renal impairment"" specifically refers to gout affecting the vertebrae due to kidney dysfunction. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a distinct form of arthritis with a different etiology and presentation."
Arthropathy of joint of left hand,36676839,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the joint of the left hand can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetrical and can affect the small joints of the hands, including the joints of the fingers. Therefore, if a patient presents with arthropathy of the joint of the left hand, it could be indicative of RA, especially when considering the characteristic joint involvement pattern of the disease. However, further evaluation with serological markers and imaging studies would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RA."
Arthropathy of left foot,37108990,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the left foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetrical and can affect small joints, such as those in the hands and feet. The presence of arthropathy in the left foot suggests joint inflammation and damage, which are characteristic features of RA. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which can manifest as arthropathy in the foot. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy of the left foot, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of joint of right hand,36676838,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthropathy of joint of right hand"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In Rheumatoid Arthritis, joint involvement is a key feature, and it often presents with joint pain, swelling, and deformities, particularly in the small joints of the hands. Therefore, if a person has arthropathy of the joint of the right hand, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis as a potential underlying cause."
Bilateral foot arthropathy,37108991,True,"Yes, bilateral foot arthropathy is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric, and the small joints of the hands and feet are commonly affected. Bilateral foot arthropathy refers to inflammation and damage in the joints of both feet, which aligns with the characteristic joint involvement seen in RA. Additionally, the presence of joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction in the feet is consistent with the clinical presentation of RA. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral foot arthropathy, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acquired valgus deformity of left knee,36685029,False,"No, acquired valgus deformity of the left knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Valgus deformity of the knee refers to a condition where the knee bends outward, away from the midline of the body. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can lead to joint deformities, including valgus deformities, there are many other potential causes for this specific condition, such as trauma, osteoarthritis, or other inflammatory arthropathies. Therefore, the presence of an acquired valgus deformity of the left knee does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acquired valgus deformity of right knee,36685028,False,"No

Rationale: Acquired valgus deformity of the right knee is a specific physical finding related to the alignment of the knee joint, which can be caused by various factors such as trauma, osteoarthritis, or ligament injuries. While rheumatoid arthritis can lead to joint deformities, it typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, not just the right knee. Therefore, the presence of an acquired valgus deformity of the right knee alone is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthropathy of right foot,37108989,True,"Yes, arthropathy of the right foot can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetrical and can affect small joints, including those in the feet. Therefore, if a patient presents with arthropathy in the right foot, it could be indicative of RA, especially when considering the characteristic joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction associated with the disease. Additional diagnostic criteria such as serological markers and imaging findings would need to be considered for a definitive diagnosis."
Bilateral arthritis of sternoclavicular joints,36685025,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral arthritis of sternoclavicular joints is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric, and arthritis of the sternoclavicular joints is a common manifestation of the disease. Additionally, the presence of arthritis in multiple joints, including the sternoclavicular joints, is one of the clinical criteria used to diagnose RA. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral arthritis of the sternoclavicular joints, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of sacroiliac joint,4067057,True,"Yes, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of sacroiliac joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Reactive arthropathy of the sacroiliac joint is a condition that involves inflammation and pain in the sacroiliac joint, which is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, inflammation can affect various joints in the body, including the sacroiliac joint. Therefore, if a patient has reactive arthropathy of the sacroiliac joint, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of shoulder,4067054,False,"No, reactive arthropathy of the shoulder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy is a term used to describe joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In this case, the involvement of the shoulder joint suggests a different etiology than Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints of the hands and feet. Additionally, the lack of mention of shoulder involvement in the description of Rheumatoid Arthritis further supports that reactive arthropathy of the shoulder is not specific to this malady."
Arthritis of bilateral shoulders caused by bacteria,37209326,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis of bilateral shoulders caused by bacteria suggests an infectious etiology rather than an autoimmune one. While RA can affect multiple joints symmetrically, the specific cause of arthritis in the shoulders being bacterial in nature does not align with the characteristic features of RA. Therefore, having arthritis of bilateral shoulders caused by bacteria does not necessarily mean that one has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of bilateral hips caused by bacteria,37209324,False,"No, the condition of arthritis of bilateral hips caused by bacteria is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint destruction and deformities, it is not typically caused by bacteria. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease, whereas arthritis caused by bacteria is usually a result of an infection (e.g., septic arthritis). Therefore, having arthritis of bilateral hips caused by bacteria does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of left flexor hallucis longus,36685043,False,"No

Rationale:
Tendinitis of the left flexor hallucis longus is a condition involving inflammation of the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle in the foot. While this condition may cause pain and discomfort in the foot, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Tendinitis of the left flexor hallucis longus is a localized condition affecting a specific tendon and is not a defining characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis."
Tendinitis of right flexor hallucis longus,36685042,False,"No

Rationale: Tendinitis of the right flexor hallucis longus is a specific condition affecting the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle in the foot. While it may cause pain and inflammation in the foot, it is not a specific symptom or diagnostic criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having tendinitis of the right flexor hallucis longus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral osteoarthritis of temporomandibular joints,37209320,False,"No

Rationale: Bilateral osteoarthritis of temporomandibular joints is a specific condition affecting the jaw joints, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, such as those in the hands and feet. While it is possible for a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis to also have osteoarthritis in the temporomandibular joints, the presence of bilateral osteoarthritis of temporomandibular joints does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis would need to be considered for a definitive diagnosis."
Arthritis of bilateral first carpometacarpal joints,37117138,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arthritis of bilateral first carpometacarpal joints"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rheumatoid Arthritis commonly affects the small joints of the hands, including the carpometacarpal joints. The presence of arthritis in the bilateral first carpometacarpal joints is a characteristic feature of RA, as it is a symmetrical polyarthritis that typically involves multiple joints on both sides of the body. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are all consistent with arthritis in the carpometacarpal joints. Therefore, if a patient has arthritis in the bilateral first carpometacarpal joints, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic rupture of anterior cruciate ligament of right knee,37117151,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the right knee is a specific condition related to a knee injury, not directly associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling, the specific condition of a chronic ACL rupture is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Mycetoma of foot,196329,False,"No.

Rationale:
Mycetoma of the foot is a chronic, localized, and progressive infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues caused by bacteria or fungi. It typically presents with painless swelling, sinuses, and discharge containing grains. Mycetoma of the foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a separate medical condition with a different etiology, presentation, and treatment. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop mycetoma of the foot due to their compromised immune system, having mycetoma of the foot does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital deformity of right knee joint,37209308,False,"No

Rationale: A congenital deformity of the right knee joint is a structural abnormality present at birth affecting the right knee joint. While this condition may cause joint deformity and functional impairment, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The presence of a congenital deformity of the right knee joint does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Occupational lung disease,4312754,False,"No

Rationale: Occupational lung disease is a condition that affects the lungs due to exposure to harmful substances in the workplace. While individuals with rheumatoid arthritis may have an increased risk of developing certain lung conditions, such as interstitial lung disease, the presence of occupational lung disease is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having occupational lung disease does not definitively mean that an individual has rheumatoid arthritis."
Bacterial arthritis of elbow,4196020,True,"Yes, bacterial arthritis of the elbow is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Bacterial arthritis is an infection of the joint caused by bacteria, leading to joint inflammation, pain, and swelling. In contrast, Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can present with joint pain and swelling, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Therefore, if a patient has bacterial arthritis of the elbow, they do not necessarily have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of left foot caused by bacteria,36685016,False,"No, arthritis of the left foot caused by bacteria is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, whereas arthritis caused by bacteria is typically a result of an infection in the joint. While both conditions may present with joint pain and swelling, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Therefore, having arthritis of the left foot caused by bacteria does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Peroneus longus tenosynovitis,4001477,False,"No

Rationale: Peroneus longus tenosynovitis is inflammation of the tendon sheath of the peroneus longus muscle in the lower leg. While this condition can cause pain and swelling in the ankle and foot, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having peroneus longus tenosynovitis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of right foot caused by bacteria,36685015,False,"No, the condition ""Arthritis of right foot caused by bacteria"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and can lead to joint destruction and deformities, it is an autoimmune disease and not caused by bacteria. In this case, the presence of bacteria as the cause of arthritis in the right foot would suggest a different type of arthritis, such as septic arthritis. Therefore, the condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the shoulder region,81656,True,"Yes, arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the shoulder region is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Behcet's syndrome is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions, and uveitis. Arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome refers to joint involvement, which can affect various joints including the shoulder region. However, this specific condition is not typically associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient presents with arthropathy in Behcet's syndrome of the shoulder region, it is not indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tibialis posterior tenosynovitis,4001476,False,"No, tibialis posterior tenosynovitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tibialis posterior tenosynovitis is an inflammation of the tendon sheath of the tibialis posterior muscle, which can cause pain, swelling, and dysfunction in the foot and ankle. While it can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having tibialis posterior tenosynovitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Seronegative arthritis,4163270,False,"No, seronegative arthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Seronegative arthritis refers to a group of inflammatory joint disorders that do not have detectable antibodies in the blood, such as rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. While some patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis may have seronegative arthritis, not all cases of seronegative arthritis are due to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Seronegative arthritis can be associated with other conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Therefore, the presence of seronegative arthritis does not definitively indicate Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of right knee,37117135,False,"No, infective arthritis of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Infective arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is a condition caused by an infection in the joint, leading to inflammation, pain, and swelling. It is typically caused by bacteria, but can also be caused by fungi or viruses. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions can present with joint pain and swelling, the underlying causes and mechanisms are different. Therefore, having infective arthritis of the right knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthrofibrosis of right knee,37117132,False,"No, arthrofibrosis of the right knee is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Arthrofibrosis is a condition characterized by excessive scar tissue formation within a joint, leading to stiffness and limited range of motion. While joint stiffness can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, arthrofibrosis can be caused by various factors such as trauma, surgery, or infection. Therefore, having arthrofibrosis of the right knee does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Loose body in bilateral knee joints,37209292,False,"No, the condition of a loose body in bilateral knee joints is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of RA, the presence of loose bodies in the knee joints is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Loose bodies in the knee joints are more commonly associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis, meniscal tears, or traumatic injuries. Therefore, having a loose body in bilateral knee joints does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Idiopathic disease,442106,False,"No, the condition ""idiopathic disease"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Idiopathic disease refers to a disease or condition that arises spontaneously or for which the cause is unknown. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is a well-defined autoimmune disorder with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings that are used for diagnosis. While the exact cause of Rheumatoid Arthritis is not fully understood, it is not considered an idiopathic disease as it has specific diagnostic criteria and known pathophysiology."
Undifferentiated spondylitis,4163267,False,"No, undifferentiated spondylitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Undifferentiated spondylitis refers to a type of spondyloarthritis that does not meet the criteria for a specific subtype such as ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis. While both Rheumatoid Arthritis and undifferentiated spondylitis are inflammatory conditions that can affect the joints, they are distinct entities with different diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches. Therefore, having undifferentiated spondylitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of bilateral hip joints,36687058,True,"Yes, arthropathy of bilateral hip joints can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the hips. The presence of arthropathy in both hip joints can be indicative of RA, especially when considered in conjunction with other clinical criteria such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. Additionally, imaging findings such as joint erosions on X-ray can further support the diagnosis of RA in this case."
Medial epicondyle apophysitis of right elbow due to overuse,37108939,False,"No, the condition of medial epicondyle apophysitis of the right elbow due to overuse is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Medial epicondyle apophysitis is a condition that typically occurs in young athletes due to repetitive stress on the elbow, leading to inflammation and pain at the medial epicondyle of the humerus. This condition is not a characteristic symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints and presents with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. 

While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain in various locations, including the elbow, the specific diagnosis of medial epicondyle apophysitis due to overuse is not indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Achilles tenosynovitis,4001475,False,"No, Achilles tenosynovitis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Achilles tenosynovitis is inflammation of the sheath surrounding the Achilles tendon, which can be caused by overuse, injury, or inflammatory conditions such as RA. While RA can cause inflammation in various joints, including the Achilles tendon, Achilles tenosynovitis can also be caused by other factors unrelated to RA. Therefore, having Achilles tenosynovitis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral arthropathy of joint of shoulder regions,36687057,True,"Yes, bilateral arthropathy of joint of shoulder regions can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetric, meaning that both sides of the body are affected equally. The presence of bilateral arthropathy in the shoulder regions could be indicative of RA, especially when combined with other symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. However, it is important to consider other possible causes of bilateral shoulder arthropathy, such as osteoarthritis or rotator cuff injuries, and to confirm the diagnosis with additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings as mentioned in the description of RA."
Bilateral arthropathy of joint of hands,36687056,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral arthropathy of joints of hands is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetrical, and the small joints of the hands are commonly affected. The presence of bilateral arthropathy of the joints of the hands is a key feature of RA and is consistent with the description of the malady provided. Therefore, if a patient presents with bilateral arthropathy of the joints of the hands, it strongly suggests the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Scleroderma-associated necrotizing vasculitis,4296513,True,"Yes, scleroderma-associated necrotizing vasculitis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale:
Scleroderma-associated necrotizing vasculitis is a rare complication of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), which is an autoimmune connective tissue disorder. Rheumatoid Arthritis is a separate autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints. While both conditions are autoimmune in nature, they are distinct entities with different clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches. Therefore, the presence of scleroderma-associated necrotizing vasculitis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Varicose veins of the leg with eczema,4077371,False,"No.

Rationale:
Varicose veins of the leg with eczema is a condition characterized by enlarged, twisted veins in the legs along with eczema, a skin condition that causes red, itchy, and inflamed skin. While varicose veins can be a symptom of various conditions, including venous insufficiency, the presence of varicose veins with eczema is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, rather than skin manifestations like eczema. Therefore, the presence of varicose veins of the leg with eczema does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthritis of lower limb due to parasitic infection,46273991,False,"No, arthritis of the lower limb due to parasitic infection is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is an autoimmune disorder, arthritis of the lower limb due to parasitic infection is caused by a different etiology, namely a parasitic infection. The symptoms, presentation, and treatment of these two conditions are also different. Therefore, having arthritis of the lower limb due to parasitic infection does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral arthritis of knees caused by Staphylococcus,37309745,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, bilateral arthritis of knees caused by Staphylococcus, is a specific type of arthritis caused by a bacterial infection. While it presents with arthritis symptoms in the knees, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). RA is an autoimmune disease characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with specific clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings. The presence of bilateral knee arthritis caused by Staphylococcus does not definitively indicate the presence of RA."
Drug-induced lupus erythematosus,4198217,False,"No

Rationale: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus is a condition caused by certain medications that can mimic the symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), such as joint pain, fatigue, and fever. While drug-induced lupus erythematosus can present with joint symptoms similar to rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having drug-induced lupus erythematosus does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Bilateral arthritis of wrists caused by Bacteria,37309744,False,"No, the condition of bilateral arthritis of wrists caused by bacteria is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can present with bilateral joint involvement, the presence of bacteria as the cause of arthritis would suggest an infectious etiology rather than an autoimmune one like RA. In this case, the condition is more likely related to a bacterial infection such as septic arthritis rather than RA. Additional diagnostic tests such as joint fluid analysis would be needed to confirm the presence of bacteria in the joints."
Arthritis of left temporomandibular joint,36687162,False,"No, arthritis of the left temporomandibular joint is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, including the temporomandibular joint, arthritis of the temporomandibular joint can be caused by various factors such as trauma, osteoarthritis, or other inflammatory conditions. Therefore, having arthritis of the left temporomandibular joint does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right temporomandibular joint,36687161,False,"No

Rationale: Arthritis of the right temporomandibular joint is a specific condition affecting the jaw joint, which is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it typically presents with joint involvement in the hands and feet, not the temporomandibular joint. Therefore, having arthritis of the right temporomandibular joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Bilateral infective arthritis of knees,37309743,True,"Yes, the condition of bilateral infective arthritis of knees is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, which means that it affects joints on both sides of the body. The condition of bilateral infective arthritis of knees fits this description as it involves both knees. Additionally, the presence of arthritis in the knees aligns with the joint involvement seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Therefore, if a person has bilateral infective arthritis of knees, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Capsulitis of bilateral temporomandibular joints,36687160,False,"No, capsulitis of bilateral temporomandibular joints is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Capsulitis of the temporomandibular joints refers to inflammation of the joint capsule in the jaw, which can cause pain, limited range of motion, and clicking or popping sounds. While Rheumatoid Arthritis can affect multiple joints in the body, including the temporomandibular joints, capsulitis of the temporomandibular joints can have various causes such as trauma, bruxism (teeth grinding), or arthritis other than RA. Therefore, having capsulitis of bilateral temporomandibular joints does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis,4220761,True,"Yes, undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis refers to a condition where a patient presents with symptoms of joint inflammation but does not meet the specific criteria for a definitive diagnosis of a particular type of arthritis, such as Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, it is important to note that undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis can progress to a specific type of arthritis, including Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, if a patient has undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis, they may eventually develop Rheumatoid Arthritis. So, if a patient has undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis, they may definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis in the future."
Chronic rheumatic pericarditis,321307,False,"No, chronic rheumatic pericarditis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Chronic rheumatic pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, which is typically caused by rheumatic fever. While rheumatic fever is also an autoimmune disorder, it is distinct from Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints. Therefore, having chronic rheumatic pericarditis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Deformity of metacarpal,4153118,True,"Yes, deformity of metacarpal can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint destruction can lead to deformities in the hands, including metacarpal deformities. This is a common manifestation of the disease due to the chronic inflammation and joint damage characteristic of RA. Therefore, if a patient has a deformity of the metacarpal, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rheumatoid factor negative and anti-citrullinated protein antibody negative juvenile polyarthritis,608043,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Rheumatoid factor negative and anti-citrullinated protein antibody negative juvenile polyarthritis"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile polyarthritis refers to arthritis that affects multiple joints in children. In this case, the condition specifies that the individual is negative for both rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, which are commonly used serological markers for Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Since Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, and the condition specifically mentions polyarthritis in a juvenile individual who is negative for the typical markers of RA, it is likely that this condition is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Cardiomyopathy,321319,False,"No, cardiomyopathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While there have been some reported cases of cardiomyopathy in patients with RA, cardiomyopathy is a broad term that refers to diseases of the heart muscle. It can be caused by a variety of factors such as genetics, infections, toxins, and other medical conditions. Therefore, having cardiomyopathy does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Eaton-Lambert syndrome,4237155,False,"No, Eaton-Lambert syndrome is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Eaton-Lambert syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness, particularly in the proximal muscles, and is caused by antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels at the neuromuscular junction. While both conditions are autoimmune in nature, they affect different systems in the body (muscles vs. joints) and have distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having Eaton-Lambert syndrome does not necessarily mean that a person also has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Rheumatoid factor negative and anti-citrullinated protein antibody positive juvenile polyarthritis,608044,True,"Yes, the condition is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rheumatoid factor negative and anti-citrullinated protein antibody positive juvenile polyarthritis is a specific subset of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that is strongly associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. The presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies is a hallmark of Rheumatoid Arthritis, and when combined with a negative rheumatoid factor, it is highly indicative of RA. Therefore, if a patient has this specific condition, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."

Autoimmune enteropathy,4341626,False,"No, autoimmune enteropathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Autoimmune enteropathy is a rare autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the small intestine, leading to malabsorption and chronic diarrhea. While autoimmune diseases can coexist, the presence of autoimmune enteropathy does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Each condition has its own distinct pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic criteria."
Disorder of upper extremity,4042503,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of upper extremity"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it can also affect other parts of the body, including the upper extremities. However, a disorder of the upper extremity could be caused by a variety of other conditions such as trauma, nerve compression, tendonitis, or other forms of arthritis. Therefore, having a disorder of the upper extremity does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Nonspecific polyarthritis,44811664,False,"No, nonspecific polyarthritis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Nonspecific polyarthritis refers to joint inflammation involving multiple joints without a specific underlying cause identified. While Rheumatoid Arthritis is a common cause of polyarthritis, there are other conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriatic arthritis, and infectious arthritis that can also present with nonspecific polyarthritis. Therefore, having nonspecific polyarthritis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy of bilateral ankle joints,37209355,True,"Yes, arthropathy of bilateral ankle joints is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is symmetric and can affect multiple joints, including the ankles. The presence of arthropathy in both ankle joints suggests a systemic autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA, which commonly affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Additionally, the description of RA mentions joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which can manifest in the ankles as well. Therefore, if a patient has arthropathy of bilateral ankle joints, it is highly indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ankylosis of bilateral knee joints,37209354,True,"Yes, ankylosis of bilateral knee joints is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ankylosis refers to the fusion of the bones in a joint, leading to loss of mobility and function. In Rheumatoid Arthritis, chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints can eventually lead to ankylosis, particularly in the knees. This condition is a result of the progressive joint damage and deformities seen in RA. Therefore, if a patient has ankylosis of bilateral knee joints, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Localized, secondary osteoarthritis of the shoulder region",77631,False,"No

Rationale: Localized, secondary osteoarthritis of the shoulder region is a specific condition that refers to osteoarthritis affecting the shoulder joint specifically. While osteoarthritis is a different type of arthritis than rheumatoid arthritis, they are both forms of arthritis. Therefore, having localized, secondary osteoarthritis of the shoulder region does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Arthropathy of bilateral wrist joints,37209353,True,"Yes, arthropathy of bilateral wrist joints is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint involvement is typically symmetrical and can affect the small joints of the hands and wrists. The presence of arthropathy in both wrist joints aligns with the characteristic joint involvement seen in RA.

While splenomegaly can be seen in some cases of RA due to systemic inflammation and extra-articular manifestations, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Splenomegaly can be caused by a variety of other conditions such as infections, hematologic disorders, liver disease, and certain cancers. Therefore, the presence of splenomegaly does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of flexor carpi radialis,40482085,False,"No, tendinitis of flexor carpi radialis is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Tendinitis of flexor carpi radialis is a condition involving inflammation of the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle in the forearm, which can cause pain and limited movement of the wrist. While it can occur in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having tendinitis of flexor carpi radialis does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthropathy,73553,False,"No, arthropathy is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Arthropathy is a general term used to describe any disease or abnormal condition affecting the joints. While Rheumatoid Arthritis is a type of arthropathy, there are many other conditions that can cause arthropathy, such as osteoarthritis, gout, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Therefore, having arthropathy does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infection associated with prosthesis of left knee joint,37309800,True,"Yes, the condition ""Infection associated with prosthesis of left knee joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis who have undergone knee joint replacement surgery, there is an increased risk of developing infections associated with the prosthesis. This is due to the chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation characteristic of RA, which can impair the body's ability to fight off infections. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis develops an infection associated with a prosthesis in the left knee joint, it is highly likely that it is related to their underlying RA."
Acute interstitial pneumonia,4341520,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Acute interstitial pneumonia, on the other hand, is a severe form of interstitial lung disease characterized by rapidly progressive respiratory failure. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as joint pain and inflammation, acute interstitial pneumonia is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Therefore, having acute interstitial pneumonia does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective arthritis of proximal interphalangeal joint of finger,40486203,True,"Yes, the condition of infective arthritis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Infective arthritis refers to a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection of a joint, which can lead to joint inflammation, pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the primary pathology is autoimmune in nature, affecting the synovial joints symmetrically and leading to joint destruction and deformities. While infective arthritis can present similarly with joint swelling, tenderness, and pain, the underlying cause is different. 

Therefore, if a patient has infective arthritis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the finger, it does not necessarily mean they have Rheumatoid Arthritis. However, if a patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis, they may develop infective arthritis as a complication due to the chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation associated with the disease."
Strain of left patellar tendon,36687224,False,"No

Rationale: A strain of the left patellar tendon is a localized injury to the tendon connecting the patella (kneecap) to the tibia. While this condition may cause knee pain and discomfort, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by systemic autoimmune inflammation, joint swelling, and deformities. Therefore, having a strain of the left patellar tendon does not definitively indicate the presence of rheumatoid arthritis."
Loose body in joint of shoulder region,73561,False,"No

Rationale: A loose body in the joint of the shoulder region is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While it can occur in various joint conditions, including osteoarthritis or traumatic injuries, it is not a defining characteristic of RA. RA primarily affects the synovial joints with characteristic symptoms such as joint swelling, tenderness, and morning stiffness. A loose body in the joint is more indicative of a mechanical issue within the joint rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA."
Late onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis,4083558,True,"Yes, late onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Late onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis refers to a form of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that presents in adulthood, typically after the age of 16. This condition is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis. The similarity in clinical presentation and joint involvement suggests that if a person has late onset polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acute drug-induced interstitial lung disorder,4110182,False,"No

Rationale: Acute drug-induced interstitial lung disorder is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While it is possible for a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis to develop drug-induced interstitial lung disorder as a side effect of medications used to treat RA, the presence of acute drug-induced interstitial lung disorder does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other factors and diagnostic criteria specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis when assessing a patient for this condition."
Strain of right patellar tendon,36687223,False,"No

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. A strain of the right patellar tendon is a localized injury to the tendon in the knee, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling in various joints, including the knee, a strain of the right patellar tendon is not a definitive indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of right ankle due to trauma,37109100,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disease like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can cause joint pain and stiffness, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the right ankle due to trauma does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Solitary sacroiliitis,73562,False,"No

Rationale: Solitary sacroiliitis refers to inflammation of a single sacroiliac joint, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While sacroiliitis can be seen in various inflammatory conditions, including spondyloarthropathies like ankylosing spondylitis, it is not a defining feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, the primary joints affected are the synovial joints in the hands and feet, rather than the sacroiliac joint. Therefore, having solitary sacroiliitis does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Late onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis,4083557,True,"Yes, late onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Late onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis refers to a form of arthritis that affects fewer than five joints and typically presents in older adults. This description aligns with the characteristics of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints and can present with symmetric polyarthritis involving multiple joints. Therefore, if a person has late onset pauciarticular chronic arthritis, they would likely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Arthritis of right ankle due to trauma,37109098,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition ""Arthritis of right ankle due to trauma"" is specific to trauma as the cause of arthritis in the right ankle. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints and is not specifically caused by trauma. While trauma can potentially lead to arthritis in a joint, RA is not directly caused by trauma. Therefore, having arthritis in the right ankle due to trauma does not necessarily mean that a person has RA."
Full thickness rotator cuff tear,73564,False,"No

Rationale: A full thickness rotator cuff tear is a specific condition related to the shoulder joint, typically caused by injury or overuse. While it can cause pain and limited range of motion in the shoulder, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. A full thickness rotator cuff tear is a localized injury to the shoulder joint and does not necessarily indicate the presence of RA."
Necrotizing vasculitis of undetermined etiology,4294428,False,"No, the condition ""Necrotizing vasculitis of undetermined etiology"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Necrotizing vasculitis is a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to blood vessel walls, which can occur in various autoimmune diseases, infections, and other conditions. While vasculitis can be seen in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having necrotizing vasculitis of undetermined etiology does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of left ankle due to trauma,37109099,False,"No.

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. It is not an autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions can affect the joints, they have different underlying causes and mechanisms. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the left ankle due to trauma does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Contracture of joint of finger,4083553,True,"Yes, contracture of joint of finger can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction can lead to deformities and functional impairment, including contractures of the joints. Contracture of joint of finger is a common manifestation of RA, particularly in the small joints of the hands. Therefore, if a patient presents with contracture of joint of finger, it may be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Intermittent effusion of joint,46273949,True,"Yes, intermittent effusion of joint can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Effusion of joints, which is the abnormal accumulation of fluid within a joint, is a common finding in Rheumatoid Arthritis due to the inflammation and synovitis that characterizes the disease. Intermittent effusion of joints can be a sign of active inflammation in RA, especially when accompanied by other symptoms such as joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness. Therefore, if a patient presents with intermittent effusion of joint, it may suggest the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Palindromic rheumatism of shoulder region,73568,False,"No

Rationale: Palindromic rheumatism is a rare form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent episodes of joint pain and swelling that typically resolve within a few days to weeks. While it shares some similarities with rheumatoid arthritis, such as joint involvement and inflammation, palindromic rheumatism is considered a distinct entity. In this case, the condition specified is specific to palindromic rheumatism and not necessarily indicative of rheumatoid arthritis."
Infective myositis of foot,4001628,False,"No

Rationale:
Infective myositis of the foot is a condition involving inflammation of the muscles in the foot due to infection. While this condition may cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and redness in the affected area, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Therefore, having infective myositis of the foot does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Scar of hand,4333347,False,"No, a scar of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A scar of the hand is a result of a previous injury or wound healing process, and it is not a defining characteristic of RA. While RA can affect the hands and cause joint deformities, the presence of a scar on the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of RA. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would be needed to diagnose RA."
Paronychia,137057,False,"No

Rationale: Paronychia is a common infection of the skin around the fingernail or toenail, typically caused by bacteria or fungi. While it can cause redness, swelling, and pain in the affected area, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Paronychia is a localized infection, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the joints. Therefore, having paronychia does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Traumatic arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot,75620,False,"No, traumatic arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Traumatic arthropathy refers to joint damage caused by trauma or injury to the joint, rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA. While traumatic arthropathy can cause symptoms similar to RA, such as joint pain and swelling, the underlying cause is different. Therefore, having traumatic arthropathy of the ankle and/or foot does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Polyarthritis associated with another disorder,4265764,True,"Yes, polyarthritis associated with another disorder can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Polyarthritis, which is inflammation affecting multiple joints, is a common feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, polyarthritis is typically symmetric and involves small joints like those in the hands and feet. Additionally, the description of RA mentions that it is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are also features of polyarthritis. Therefore, if a patient presents with polyarthritis associated with another disorder, it could be indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis,253797,False,"No

Rationale: Post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis is a condition that involves scarring of the lungs following inflammation or injury. While it can be associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, it is not specific to RA. There are many other potential causes of post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis, such as infections, environmental exposures, and other autoimmune conditions. Therefore, having post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Infective myositis of lower leg,4001627,False,"No

Rationale: Infective myositis of the lower leg refers to an infection of the muscles in the lower leg, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically involve muscle infections. Therefore, having infective myositis of the lower leg does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Infective myositis of hand,4001626,False,"No

Rationale: Infective myositis of the hand refers to an infection of the muscles in the hand, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically involve muscle infections. Therefore, having infective myositis of the hand does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pericarditis,4138837,False,"No

Rationale:
Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. While pericarditis can be seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as a potential extra-articular manifestation of the disease, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Pericarditis can also occur in other conditions such as viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and after a heart attack. Therefore, having pericarditis does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Articular cartilage disorder of hand,75628,True,"Yes, the condition ""Articular cartilage disorder of hand"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, the chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints can lead to damage to the articular cartilage in the hands, resulting in joint pain, swelling, and deformities. Therefore, if a person has an articular cartilage disorder in the hand, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of 1st metatarsophalangeal joint,4065104,False,"No, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of 1st metatarsophalangeal joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy refers to joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition. In this case, the involvement of the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint suggests a localized issue rather than the systemic and symmetric polyarthritis characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of RA, the specific location and nature of the joint inflammation described in the condition do not align with the typical presentation of RA. Therefore, having reactive arthropathy of the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of interphalangeal joint of toe,4065105,True,"Yes, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of interphalangeal joint of toe"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis is characterized by joint involvement, including the small joints of the hands and feet. The condition ""Reactive arthropathy of interphalangeal joint of toe"" specifically mentions joint involvement in the toe, which aligns with the presentation of RA. Additionally, the term ""reactive arthropathy"" suggests an inflammatory response in the joint, which is a key feature of RA. Therefore, if a patient has reactive arthropathy of the interphalangeal joint of the toe, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Disorder of lung,257907,False,"No, a disorder of the lung is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is primarily a joint disorder, it can also affect other organs in the body, including the lungs. In some cases, RA can lead to complications such as interstitial lung disease or pleuritis. However, a disorder of the lung can be caused by various other conditions as well, such as infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or lung cancer. Therefore, having a disorder of the lung does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of right calf co-occurrent and due to varicose ulcer,761723,False,"No

Rationale: Inflammation of the right calf due to a varicose ulcer is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition is more likely related to venous insufficiency and ulceration, rather than the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that characterizes RA. While inflammation can be a symptom of RA, it is not typically localized to a specific area like the right calf in the context of a varicose ulcer. Therefore, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of right foot co-occurrent and due to varicose ulcer,761722,False,"No

Rationale: Inflammation of the right foot due to a varicose ulcer is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While inflammation can be a symptom of RA, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. In this case, the inflammation is specifically attributed to a varicose ulcer, which is a separate condition unrelated to RA. RA is primarily characterized by symmetric polyarthritis affecting multiple joints, particularly in the hands and feet, along with other specific clinical criteria and serological markers."
Bilateral arthrofibrosis fibrosis of knees,36687198,True,"Yes, bilateral arthrofibrosis fibrosis of knees is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Arthrofibrosis is a condition characterized by excessive scar tissue formation in the joint, leading to stiffness and limited range of motion. In the case of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the chronic inflammation and destruction of the synovial joints can lead to arthrofibrosis in the knees. Therefore, if a patient has bilateral arthrofibrosis fibrosis of knees, it is highly likely that they have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of left thigh co-occurrent and due to varicose ulcer,761721,False,"No, inflammation of the left thigh co-occurrent and due to varicose ulcer is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Inflammation of the left thigh due to a varicose ulcer is not a typical symptom of RA. Varicose ulcers are typically caused by poor circulation in the legs, leading to skin breakdown and ulcer formation. 

Therefore, while a person with RA may potentially have inflammation in the left thigh due to a varicose ulcer, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of left ankle co-occurrent and due to varicose ulcer,761727,False,"No

Rationale: Inflammation of the left ankle co-occurring and due to a varicose ulcer is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While inflammation can be a symptom of RA, it is not specific to this condition and can be caused by various other factors such as infections, injuries, or other inflammatory conditions. Additionally, varicose ulcers are typically associated with venous insufficiency rather than autoimmune conditions like RA. Therefore, the presence of inflammation in the left ankle due to a varicose ulcer does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of right thigh co-occurrent and due to varicose ulcer,761726,False,"No

Rationale: Inflammation of the right thigh co-occurring and due to a varicose ulcer is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. This condition is more likely related to the presence of a varicose ulcer, which is a result of venous insufficiency and not an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA. While inflammation can be a symptom of RA, in this case, it is directly linked to the varicose ulcer and not indicative of RA."
Autoimmune disorder of inner ear,4337463,False,"No, the condition ""Autoimmune disorder of inner ear"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA is an autoimmune disorder, it primarily affects the synovial joints and is not typically associated with inner ear involvement. Autoimmune inner ear disease is a separate condition that involves the immune system attacking the inner ear structures, leading to symptoms such as hearing loss, dizziness, and imbalance. Therefore, having an autoimmune disorder of the inner ear does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of right lower leg co-occurrent and due to varicose ulcer,761725,False,"No, the condition ""Inflammation of right lower leg co-occurrent and due to varicose ulcer"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, causing symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. The condition described, inflammation of the right lower leg due to a varicose ulcer, is more likely related to venous insufficiency and ulceration rather than RA. 

While RA can present with systemic inflammation, it typically does not manifest as localized inflammation in the lower leg due to a varicose ulcer. Therefore, the presence of this specific condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Carbuncle of upper arm and forearm,132987,False,"No

Rationale:
A carbuncle of the upper arm and forearm is a localized skin infection caused by bacteria, typically Staphylococcus aureus. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not manifest as a skin infection like a carbuncle. Therefore, having a carbuncle of the upper arm and forearm does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Subcutaneous nodule associated with lupus erythematosus,4296507,False,"No, the condition of a subcutaneous nodule associated with lupus erythematosus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Subcutaneous nodules are actually a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, not lupus erythematosus. These nodules are firm, non-tender lumps that develop under the skin, typically over bony prominences or areas of repeated pressure. Therefore, if a patient presents with subcutaneous nodules, it is more indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis rather than lupus erythematosus."
Post-infective arthritis of joint of foot,4173757,False,"No

Rationale: Post-infective arthritis of the joint of the foot is a specific condition that occurs after an infection in the joint of the foot. While it shares some similarities with rheumatoid arthritis in terms of joint involvement and inflammation, it is a distinct condition caused by a previous infection rather than an autoimmune disorder like RA. Therefore, having post-infective arthritis of the joint of the foot does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Anterior uveitis,4132792,True,"Yes, anterior uveitis can be specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Anterior uveitis is inflammation of the uvea, specifically affecting the iris and ciliary body. It is a common extra-articular manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis, occurring in up to 25% of patients with RA. The presence of anterior uveitis in a patient with RA can be a strong indicator of the underlying autoimmune disease. Additionally, the systemic inflammation seen in RA can also affect the eyes, leading to uveitis. Therefore, if a patient with RA has anterior uveitis, it is highly likely that the two conditions are related."
Osteomyelitis of shoulder region,133003,False,"No

Rationale: Osteomyelitis of the shoulder region is a bacterial infection of the bone in the shoulder area, which is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop osteomyelitis as a complication, having osteomyelitis of the shoulder region does not definitively mean that the patient has Rheumatoid Arthritis. The two conditions are distinct entities with different etiologies and diagnostic criteria."
Inflammation of left calf co-occurrent and due to varicose ulcer,761730,False,"No

Rationale: Inflammation of the left calf co-occurring and due to a varicose ulcer is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While inflammation can be a symptom of RA, it is not typically localized to a specific area like the left calf. In this case, the inflammation is specifically attributed to a varicose ulcer, which is a separate condition unrelated to RA. Therefore, having inflammation of the left calf due to a varicose ulcer does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of lower leg due to varicose ulcer,761729,False,"No, inflammation of the lower leg due to a varicose ulcer is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Inflammation of the lower leg due to a varicose ulcer is a localized condition caused by poor circulation and venous insufficiency, leading to the development of ulcers. Rheumatoid Arthritis, on the other hand, is a systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints. While inflammation is a common feature in both conditions, they have different underlying causes and presentations. Therefore, having inflammation of the lower leg due to a varicose ulcer does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflammation of right ankle co-occurrent and due to varicose ulcer,761728,False,"No

Rationale:
The condition described, inflammation of the right ankle co-occurrent and due to a varicose ulcer, is specific to a varicose ulcer and not necessarily indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While inflammation can be a symptom of RA, the specific cause of the inflammation in this case is attributed to the varicose ulcer. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that the individual has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Lupus erythematosus,255891,False,"No, Lupus erythematosus is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions are autoimmune diseases, they are distinct entities with different pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic criteria. Lupus erythematosus (specifically systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE) is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including skin rashes, joint pain, fatigue, and organ involvement, such as the kidneys, heart, and lungs. Diagnosis of SLE is based on a combination of clinical criteria, laboratory tests (e.g., antinuclear antibodies), and imaging studies. While there can be some overlap in symptoms between RA and SLE, having Lupus erythematosus does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pyogenic arthritis of foot,4288479,True,"Yes, pyogenic arthritis of the foot is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Pyogenic arthritis, also known as septic arthritis, is an infection of the joint that can occur in patients with RA due to the compromised immune system and joint damage associated with the disease. Therefore, if a patient has pyogenic arthritis of the foot, they definitely have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Osteoarthritis of wrist and hand due to and following trauma,37311898,False,"No

Rationale: Osteoarthritis of the wrist and hand due to and following trauma is a specific condition that is not necessarily indicative of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While both conditions involve joint pain and swelling in the hands, osteoarthritis is primarily a degenerative joint disease caused by wear and tear on the joints, whereas Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. The presence of osteoarthritis due to trauma does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Mass of subcutaneous tissue,46269798,False,"No, a mass of subcutaneous tissue is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint swelling is a common symptom of RA, a mass of subcutaneous tissue could be indicative of a variety of other conditions such as lipomas, cysts, or abscesses. It is important to consider other symptoms and diagnostic criteria specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis when assessing for this malady."
Infection associated with prosthesis of right knee joint,37309854,True,"Yes, the condition ""Infection associated with prosthesis of right knee joint"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis who have undergone knee replacement surgery, there is an increased risk of developing infections associated with the prosthesis due to the chronic autoimmune inflammatory nature of the disease. Therefore, if a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis presents with an infection associated with the prosthesis of the right knee joint, it is highly likely that it is related to their underlying condition."
Allergic arthritis of spine,4323203,False,"No, allergic arthritis of the spine is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Allergic arthritis is a type of arthritis that occurs as a result of an allergic reaction, typically to certain medications or infections. It is not a characteristic feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is primarily characterized by symmetric polyarthritis affecting the synovial joints. Therefore, having allergic arthritis of the spine does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Hand joint inflamed,4182008,True,"Yes, the condition ""Hand joint inflamed"" is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. In RA, joint inflammation, particularly in the small joints of the hands, is a common symptom. This inflammation can lead to joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which are characteristic features of RA. Therefore, if someone has inflamed hand joints, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Inflamed joint,4182007,True,"Yes, an inflamed joint is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Inflammation of the joints is a hallmark feature of RA, as mentioned in the description of the malady. RA is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction, which can lead to deformities and functional impairment. Therefore, if someone has an inflamed joint, it is highly suggestive of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Congenital anomaly of the hand,4145142,False,"No, a congenital anomaly of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. A congenital anomaly of the hand refers to a structural abnormality present at birth, which is not directly related to the autoimmune inflammatory disorder that is Rheumatoid Arthritis. While individuals with Rheumatoid Arthritis may experience joint deformities in the hands over time due to the disease process, the presence of a congenital anomaly of the hand does not necessarily indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Pain of left hand due to and following cerebrovascular accident,761799,False,"No, pain of the left hand due to and following a cerebrovascular accident is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Pain in the left hand following a cerebrovascular accident (stroke) is likely due to neurological damage caused by the stroke, rather than the autoimmune inflammatory process seen in Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can cause joint pain and swelling in the hands, the specific cause of pain in the left hand following a stroke would not be attributed to RA. It is important to consider the patient's medical history, physical examination findings, and diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause of the pain in this scenario."
Complex regional pain syndrome of hand,42536260,False,"No.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) of the hand is a chronic pain condition that typically affects one limb, often following an injury or trauma. While CRPS can cause joint stiffness, swelling, and changes in skin temperature and color, it is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). RA is characterized by autoimmune inflammation primarily affecting the synovial joints, leading to joint destruction and deformities. While some symptoms of CRPS and RA may overlap, they are distinct conditions with different underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having CRPS of the hand does not definitively mean that a person has RA."
Infected hand,4102128,False,"No

Rationale: An infected hand is a condition that can be caused by various factors such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi entering a wound or cut on the hand. While joint infections can occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, an infected hand is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. It can occur in individuals without rheumatoid arthritis as well. Therefore, having an infected hand does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Rheumatic fever,442313,False,"No, rheumatic fever is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can develop as a complication of untreated streptococcal infections, particularly strep throat. It primarily affects the heart, joints, skin, and brain. While both rheumatic fever and Rheumatoid Arthritis involve inflammation and joint symptoms, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having rheumatic fever does not necessarily mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Non-traumatic rupture of tendon of left patella,765915,False,"No

Rationale: A non-traumatic rupture of the tendon of the left patella is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA can lead to joint damage and deformities, a rupture of the patellar tendon is a specific injury that can occur due to various reasons such as sudden trauma or chronic overuse. It is not a defining characteristic of RA."
Osteoarthritis of elbow,4083695,False,"No

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis of the elbow is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the elbow joint, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. While both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are types of arthritis, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and characteristics. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. Osteoarthritis, on the other hand, is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage in the joints. Therefore, having osteoarthritis of the elbow does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Old disruption of ligament of knee,4032488,False,"No, the condition ""Old disruption of ligament of knee"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While joint involvement is a common feature of RA, an old disruption of the ligament of the knee is not a defining characteristic of the disease. RA primarily affects the synovial joints and is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. An old disruption of the ligament of the knee may be a result of a previous injury or trauma, rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder like RA."
Arthritis of left ankle due to trauma,37117422,False,"No.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and it is not specifically caused by trauma. While trauma can lead to arthritis in a joint, the presence of arthritis in the left ankle due to trauma does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Additional clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings would need to be considered to make a diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of tibiofibular joint,4067300,False,"No, the condition ""Reactive arthropathy of tibiofibular joint"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy is a term used to describe joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In this case, the involvement of the tibiofibular joint suggests a different etiology than Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints. Additionally, the description of Rheumatoid Arthritis does not mention reactive arthropathy as a common feature of the disease. Therefore, having reactive arthropathy of the tibiofibular joint does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of ankle,4067301,False,"No.

Rationale:
Reactive arthropathy of the ankle is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy is a type of arthritis that occurs as a reaction to an infection or inflammation in another part of the body. It is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis. While it is possible for a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis to develop reactive arthropathy of the ankle, having reactive arthropathy of the ankle does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Reactive arthropathy of elbow,4067299,False,"No

Rationale:
Reactive arthropathy of the elbow is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. Reactive arthropathy is a term used to describe joint inflammation that occurs as a reaction to an infection or another condition in the body. In this case, the condition is localized to the elbow joint and is not a defining characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis, which primarily affects the synovial joints in a symmetric pattern. While joint inflammation can be a symptom of Rheumatoid Arthritis, the specific location and nature of the reactive arthropathy of the elbow do not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Immune dysregulation, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, recurrent infection syndrome",36675057,False,"No, the condition ""Immune dysregulation, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, recurrent infection syndrome"" is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While immune dysregulation and arthritis are common features of Rheumatoid Arthritis, they can also be present in other conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease and recurrent infection syndrome are not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis and can be seen in a variety of other conditions as well. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile ankylosing spondylitis,4083681,False,"No, juvenile ankylosing spondylitis is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Juvenile ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, causing inflammation and stiffness. It is not characterized by the symmetric polyarthritis seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the diagnostic criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings for juvenile ankylosing spondylitis are different from those of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, having juvenile ankylosing spondylitis does not necessarily mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Fracture of head of humerus,37311960,False,"No

Rationale: A fracture of the head of the humerus is a physical injury to the bone, typically caused by trauma or a fall. While it can cause joint pain and swelling in the affected area, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, and a fracture of the head of the humerus is a separate condition caused by physical trauma. Therefore, having a fracture of the head of the humerus does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Synovial cyst of hand,35624442,False,"No, a synovial cyst of the hand is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

A synovial cyst of the hand is a fluid-filled sac that forms in the joints of the hand, typically due to degenerative changes or trauma. While Rheumatoid Arthritis primarily affects the synovial joints, the presence of a synovial cyst in the hand does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is important to consider other factors such as clinical criteria, serological markers, and imaging findings to diagnose Rheumatoid Arthritis accurately."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent monoarthritis",37207517,True,"Yes, the condition ""Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent monoarthritis"" is specific to the malady Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Rationale:
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a group of chronic inflammatory diseases affecting children under the age of 16, with persistent monoarthritis being a subtype where only one joint is affected. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, characterized by symmetric polyarthritis with joint swelling, tenderness, and destruction. While JIA and RA are separate conditions, the presence of persistent monoarthritis in a juvenile patient can be indicative of RA, as RA can also present with joint involvement, swelling, and destruction. Therefore, if a patient has the condition of ""Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent monoarthritis,"" they definitely have the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Madelung's deformity,434157,False,"No

Rationale:
Madelung's deformity is a congenital condition characterized by abnormal growth of the distal radial epiphysis, leading to a deformity of the wrist. It is not specifically associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may develop deformities in the joints, Madelung's deformity is not a specific indicator of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Ingrowing thumbnail,4065237,False,"No

Rationale: An ingrowing thumbnail is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While RA primarily affects the synovial joints, it does not typically present with symptoms related to ingrowing thumbnails. Ingrowing thumbnails are more commonly associated with conditions such as ingrown toenails or fungal infections."
Iliotibial band friction syndrome,4173780,False,"No

Rationale:
Iliotibial band friction syndrome is a common overuse injury that occurs in runners and cyclists, characterized by pain on the lateral aspect of the knee due to friction of the iliotibial band over the lateral femoral epicondyle. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a musculoskeletal issue related to repetitive motion rather than an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the synovial joints. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially experience iliotibial band friction syndrome as a secondary issue, having iliotibial band friction syndrome does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Medial epicondyle apophysitis due to overuse,45757777,False,"No

Rationale:
Medial epicondyle apophysitis due to overuse is a condition commonly seen in young athletes, particularly baseball pitchers, gymnasts, and tennis players. It is characterized by pain and tenderness over the medial epicondyle of the elbow, which is exacerbated by repetitive throwing or gripping activities. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis, as it is a localized overuse injury rather than a systemic autoimmune disease affecting multiple joints. While a patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially experience medial epicondyle apophysitis due to overuse as a secondary issue, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Tendinitis of wrist,4173776,False,"No

Rationale: Tendinitis of the wrist is a condition characterized by inflammation or irritation of the tendons in the wrist, often due to repetitive movements or overuse. While wrist tendinitis can cause pain and swelling in the wrist joint, it is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis. While wrist involvement can occur in RA, it is not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having tendinitis of the wrist does not definitively mean that a person has rheumatoid arthritis."
Thumb onychia,46269747,False,"No

Rationale: Thumb onychia, which refers to inflammation of the nail matrix, is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While thumb onychia can occur in patients with RA due to the inflammatory nature of the disease, it is not a defining characteristic of RA. Thumb onychia can also be caused by other conditions such as fungal infections, trauma, or psoriasis. Therefore, the presence of thumb onychia does not definitively indicate the presence of Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent oligoarthritis",4132812,True,"Yes, the condition of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent oligoarthritis is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a group of chronic inflammatory diseases affecting children under the age of 16, with persistent oligoarthritis being one of the subtypes. This condition is characterized by arthritis involving fewer than five joints, with a higher risk of developing Rheumatoid Factor-positive polyarthritis in the future. 

Given that persistent oligoarthritis is a subtype of JIA that can progress to Rheumatoid Factor-positive polyarthritis, which is a form of Rheumatoid Arthritis, having this specific condition would indicate a higher likelihood of developing Rheumatoid Arthritis in the future. Therefore, if a person has juvenile idiopathic arthritis, persistent oligoarthritis, they are more likely to have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Acute lymphangitis of finger,46269745,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute lymphangitis of the finger is an infection of the lymphatic vessels, typically caused by bacteria entering through a break in the skin. This condition is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While a person with Rheumatoid Arthritis may potentially develop acute lymphangitis of the finger, having acute lymphangitis of the finger does not definitively mean that a person has Rheumatoid Arthritis. The two conditions are not directly related in terms of causation or diagnosis."
"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, oligoarthritis",4132811,True,"Yes, the condition of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, oligoarthritis is specific to the malady of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, oligoarthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that primarily affects fewer than five joints, often the knees and ankles. This condition is considered a form of autoimmune arthritis, similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis, and can lead to joint swelling, pain, and stiffness. Therefore, if a person has juvenile idiopathic arthritis, oligoarthritis, they may also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Necrotizing vasculitis secondary to connective tissue disease,4292533,True,"Yes, the condition of necrotizing vasculitis secondary to connective tissue disease is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: Necrotizing vasculitis is a known complication of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as the chronic inflammation and immune system dysfunction in RA can lead to damage of blood vessels. Additionally, connective tissue diseases, such as RA, are known to be associated with vasculitis. Therefore, if a patient has necrotizing vasculitis secondary to connective tissue disease, it is highly likely that the underlying cause is Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Juvenile seronegative polyarthritis,4132810,True,"Yes, juvenile seronegative polyarthritis is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Juvenile seronegative polyarthritis is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) characterized by arthritis in five or more joints, with a negative rheumatoid factor. This condition is similar to adult-onset RA in terms of joint involvement and inflammation, but it occurs in children. Since juvenile seronegative polyarthritis shares similar characteristics with RA, it can be considered specific to the malady."
Necrotizing vasculitis due to mixed cryoglobulinemia,4292535,True,"Yes, the condition of necrotizing vasculitis due to mixed cryoglobulinemia is specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. 

Rationale: Necrotizing vasculitis due to mixed cryoglobulinemia is a rare complication of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Cryoglobulinemia is an immune complex-mediated vasculitis that can occur in patients with RA. Therefore, if a patient has necrotizing vasculitis due to mixed cryoglobulinemia, it is highly likely that they also have Rheumatoid Arthritis."
Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure,4177862,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure is not specific to Rheumatoid Arthritis. While respiratory involvement can occur in RA due to conditions such as interstitial lung disease or pleuritis, chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure is a general respiratory condition that can have various causes unrelated to RA. It is important to investigate the underlying cause of chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure to determine appropriate management."
