Occlusion of circumflex branch of left coronary artery,604426,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

In AMI, the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leads to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, resulting in a heart attack. The circumflex branch of the left coronary artery is one of the main arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. If this branch becomes occluded, it can lead to a heart attack by causing a lack of blood flow to a portion of the myocardium, resulting in myocardial cell death.

Therefore, if a patient has the condition of occlusion of the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery, it is highly likely that they have or are at risk of developing an acute myocardial infarction."
Atrial cardiopathy,3655971,False,"No

Rationale:
Atrial cardiopathy is a term used to describe structural and functional changes in the atria that may predispose individuals to atrial fibrillation and stroke. While atrial cardiopathy may increase the risk of certain cardiovascular events, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI is primarily caused by coronary artery occlusion leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis, which is distinct from the changes seen in atrial cardiopathy. Therefore, having atrial cardiopathy does not definitively mean that an individual will have an AMI."
Pericarditis secondary to acute myocardial infarction,4322145,True,"Yes, pericarditis secondary to acute myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. In the context of acute myocardial infarction, pericarditis can occur as a complication due to the inflammatory response triggered by myocardial necrosis. This condition is specific to acute myocardial infarction because it is a direct consequence of the heart attack itself. Therefore, if a patient has pericarditis secondary to acute myocardial infarction, they definitely have the malady of acute myocardial infarction."
Supraventricular tachycardia following acute myocardial infarction,609068,True,"Yes, the condition of supraventricular tachycardia following acute myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of acute myocardial infarction. 

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a rapid heart rhythm originating above the ventricles, often characterized by a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute. In the context of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), SVT can occur as a complication due to the ischemic damage to the heart tissue. The stress on the heart from the AMI can lead to abnormal electrical impulses and trigger episodes of SVT.

Therefore, if a patient presents with supraventricular tachycardia following an acute myocardial infarction, it is highly likely that the underlying cause of the SVT is the AMI itself. The presence of SVT in this scenario would be a specific indicator of the AMI."
Unstable angina co-occurrent and due to coronary arteriosclerosis,36712982,True,"Yes, the condition of unstable angina co-occurrent and due to coronary arteriosclerosis is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Unstable angina is a condition characterized by chest pain or discomfort that occurs at rest or with minimal exertion and is due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It is considered a precursor to AMI, as it indicates an unstable plaque in the coronary arteries that may rupture and lead to a heart attack. Coronary arteriosclerosis refers to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can eventually lead to the occlusion of a coronary artery and result in AMI. Therefore, if a person has unstable angina co-occurrent and due to coronary arteriosclerosis, they are at high risk for developing AMI."
Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure,44782733,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure is a condition characterized by the exacerbation of both systolic and diastolic heart failure symptoms, leading to acute decompensation of heart function. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to heart failure as a complication, not all cases of acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure are directly caused by a heart attack. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that the individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Rupture of ventricle due to acute myocardial infarction,4147223,True,"Yes, the condition ""Rupture of ventricle due to acute myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rupture of the ventricle is a serious complication that can occur as a result of an acute myocardial infarction. When a heart attack leads to significant damage to the heart muscle, it can weaken the ventricular wall and potentially lead to rupture. This complication is directly related to the occurrence of an acute myocardial infarction and is not typically seen in other conditions. Therefore, if a patient experiences a rupture of the ventricle, it is highly likely that they have also suffered from an acute myocardial infarction."
Mural thrombus of left ventricle following acute myocardial infarction,36712985,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Mural thrombus of left ventricle following acute myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale:
A mural thrombus of the left ventricle is a complication that can occur following an acute myocardial infarction. The occlusion of a coronary artery during a heart attack can lead to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, which can result in the formation of a thrombus within the left ventricle. This complication is directly related to the initial event of acute myocardial infarction and is a known consequence of the condition. Therefore, if a patient has a mural thrombus of the left ventricle following an acute myocardial infarction, it is indicative that they have experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Old myocardial infarction,314666,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Old myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale: An old myocardial infarction refers to a previous heart attack that has already occurred and resulted in damage to the heart muscle. Since Acute Myocardial Infarction is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, an old myocardial infarction would be a past event of this nature. Therefore, if someone has an old myocardial infarction, it indicates that they have previously experienced Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Cardiac rupture due to and following acute myocardial infarction,4124687,True,"Yes, the condition of cardiac rupture due to and following acute myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Cardiac rupture is a serious complication that can occur following an acute myocardial infarction, where the necrotic myocardial tissue becomes weakened and may tear, leading to rupture of the heart muscle. This complication is directly related to the initial event of acute myocardial infarction and is a known consequence of the ischemic damage to the myocardium. Therefore, if a patient has cardiac rupture due to and following acute myocardial infarction, it is a clear indication that they have experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Rupture of interventricular septum following acute myocardial infarction,609083,True,"Yes, the condition ""Rupture of interventricular septum following acute myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady ""Acute Myocardial Infarction."" 

Rupture of the interventricular septum is a serious complication that can occur following an acute myocardial infarction. It is a direct consequence of the necrosis and weakening of the myocardium due to the heart attack. This condition is specific to acute myocardial infarction because it is a complication that arises as a result of the initial occlusion of a coronary artery and subsequent myocardial damage. Therefore, if a patient has a rupture of the interventricular septum following an acute myocardial infarction, it is indicative that they have experienced a heart attack."
Acute systolic heart failure,40480603,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute systolic heart failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to acute systolic heart failure as a complication, there are other causes of acute systolic heart failure such as severe valvular heart disease, viral myocarditis, or acute decompensation of chronic heart failure. Therefore, having acute systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has acute myocardial infarction."
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure,40480602,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure is a condition characterized by the acute decompensation of chronic heart failure, leading to worsening symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention. While acute on chronic systolic heart failure can increase the risk of developing complications such as acute myocardial infarction, it is not specific to the malady itself. Acute myocardial infarction is a distinct event involving the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which may or may not occur in the setting of chronic heart failure. Therefore, having acute on chronic systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that an individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Myocardial infarction,4329847,True,"Yes, the condition of myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). If a person has a myocardial infarction, they definitely have experienced a heart attack, which is the defining characteristic of AMI. The condition of myocardial infarction is a direct indicator of the malady of AMI, as it refers to the death of cardiac tissue due to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery. Therefore, the presence of myocardial infarction confirms the diagnosis of AMI."
Inferior ST segment elevation,45767555,True,"Yes, Inferior ST segment elevation is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).

Rationale:
Inferior ST segment elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a classic finding in patients with AMI involving the inferior wall of the heart. This pattern of ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF is indicative of ischemia in the inferior region of the heart, which is commonly caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery or the left circumflex artery. Therefore, if a patient presents with inferior ST segment elevation, it is highly suggestive of AMI. However, it is important to note that not all cases of AMI may present with this specific ECG finding, as other patterns such as ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V4) or new-onset Q waves may also be seen."
Postmyocardial infarction syndrome,319038,True,"Yes, postmyocardial infarction syndrome is specific to acute myocardial infarction. 

Postmyocardial infarction syndrome refers to a group of complications that can occur following a heart attack, such as pericarditis, Dressler syndrome, and ventricular aneurysm. These complications are directly related to the damage caused by the acute myocardial infarction and are not typically seen in other conditions. Therefore, if a patient is diagnosed with postmyocardial infarction syndrome, it is highly likely that they have previously experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Left anterior descending coronary artery thrombosis,4153091,True,"Yes, left anterior descending coronary artery thrombosis is specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The left anterior descending coronary artery is one of the major arteries that supplies blood to the heart muscle, and thrombosis in this artery can lead to the sudden occlusion of blood flow, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue characteristic of AMI. Therefore, if a patient has left anterior descending coronary artery thrombosis, they definitely have the malady of acute myocardial infarction."
Anterior ST segment elevation,45767556,True,"Yes, anterior ST segment elevation is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Anterior ST segment elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a classic finding in AMI, particularly in cases where the occlusion of the coronary artery affects the anterior wall of the heart. This specific ECG pattern is indicative of myocardial ischemia and necrosis, which are characteristic features of AMI. Therefore, if a patient presents with anterior ST segment elevation, it strongly suggests the presence of AMI. However, it is important to note that not all cases of AMI may present with anterior ST segment elevation, as the location of the occluded coronary artery can vary."
Acute coronary artery occlusion not resulting in myocardial infarction,44784623,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute coronary artery occlusion not resulting in myocardial infarction is a condition where there is a sudden blockage of a coronary artery, but it does not lead to myocardial cell death and the release of cardiac biomarkers. In contrast, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) specifically involves the occlusion of a coronary artery resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, leading to the characteristic symptoms and diagnostic criteria mentioned in the description. Therefore, if a person has acute coronary artery occlusion not resulting in myocardial infarction, they do not definitively have AMI."
Coronary occlusion,316995,True,"Yes, coronary occlusion is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Coronary occlusion refers to the sudden blockage of a coronary artery, which is the primary event that leads to AMI. In AMI, the occlusion results in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, causing a heart attack. Therefore, if someone has a coronary occlusion, they definitely have AMI."
Acute respiratory failure,319049,False,"No

Rationale: Acute respiratory failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Acute respiratory failure is a condition characterized by the inability of the respiratory system to maintain adequate gas exchange, leading to hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. While acute respiratory failure can occur as a complication of acute myocardial infarction due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or other factors, it is not a defining feature of the malady itself. Therefore, having acute respiratory failure does not definitively mean that a person has acute myocardial infarction."
Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia,437579,False,"No

Rationale:
Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia is a condition characterized by episodes of rapid heart rate originating from the ventricles of the heart. While paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia can be a symptom or complication of acute myocardial infarction, it is not specific to this malady. There are various other causes of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, such as electrolyte imbalances, structural heart disease, and certain medications. Therefore, having paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia does not definitively mean that a person has acute myocardial infarction."
Generalized ischemic myocardial dysfunction,4110961,False,"No, generalized ischemic myocardial dysfunction is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While AMI involves ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue due to the occlusion of a coronary artery, generalized ischemic myocardial dysfunction can be caused by various other conditions such as severe coronary artery disease, myocarditis, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having generalized ischemic myocardial dysfunction does not definitively mean that a person has AMI, as the dysfunction could be due to a different underlying cause."
Occlusion of anterior descending branch of left coronary artery,3655011,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). In AMI, the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, such as the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery, leads to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, resulting in a heart attack. Therefore, if a person has the condition of occlusion of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction,45766114,True,"Yes, subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Rationale: Subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction refers to a recurrent heart attack characterized by ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography (ECG) following an initial AMI. Therefore, if a patient has subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, it is indicative of a previous AMI. This condition is a direct consequence of AMI and is a clear indicator of the presence of the malady."
Disorder of cardiac ventricle,4166245,False,"No, a disorder of the cardiac ventricle is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While AMI can lead to damage of the cardiac ventricle due to the ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, a disorder of the cardiac ventricle can be caused by various other conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or valvular heart disease. Therefore, having a disorder of the cardiac ventricle does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Dissection of coronary artery,37115756,False,"No

Rationale: While a dissection of a coronary artery can lead to reduced blood flow and potentially result in ischemia, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A dissection of a coronary artery can occur in various conditions, including but not limited to AMI, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), and aortic dissection. Therefore, having a dissection of a coronary artery does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction of anterior wall,45766113,True,"Yes, the condition of subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale: The condition specifically mentions a subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall, which is a type of acute myocardial infarction. The description of the malady also includes information about ST-segment elevation on ECG being indicative of AMI. Therefore, if a patient has a subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall, they definitely have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Congestive heart failure,319835,False,"No

Rationale:
Congestive heart failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to congestive heart failure as a complication, congestive heart failure can have various causes such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having congestive heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has had an acute myocardial infarction."
Delayed postmyocardial infarction pericarditis,37311078,False,"No

Rationale:
Delayed postmyocardial infarction pericarditis is a specific condition that occurs after a myocardial infarction, but not all patients who have had a myocardial infarction will develop pericarditis. Therefore, having delayed postmyocardial infarction pericarditis does not definitively mean that the individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Acute ischemic heart disease,319844,True,"Yes, acute ischemic heart disease is specific to acute myocardial infarction. Acute ischemic heart disease refers to a sudden decrease in blood flow to the heart muscle, which can lead to a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction). Therefore, if someone has acute ischemic heart disease, they definitely have the potential to develop a heart attack."
Left ventricular abnormality,442982,False,"No

Rationale: A left ventricular abnormality is a broad term that can encompass a variety of conditions affecting the left ventricle of the heart, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular dilation, or left ventricular dysfunction. While left ventricular abnormalities can be a consequence of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), they are not specific to AMI. Left ventricular abnormalities can also be caused by other conditions such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having a left ventricular abnormality does not definitively mean that a person has experienced an AMI."
Occlusion of posterior lateral branch of right coronary artery,3655760,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the posterior lateral branch of the right coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). In the description of AMI, it is mentioned that AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. The occlusion of the posterior lateral branch of the right coronary artery would lead to a lack of blood flow to a portion of the myocardium, causing myocardial cell death and subsequent release of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin, which are indicative of AMI. Therefore, if a person has the condition of occlusion of this specific coronary artery branch, they would definitely have the malady of AMI."
Ischemic heart disease,4185932,True,"Yes, the condition of Ischemic heart disease is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. Ischemic heart disease refers to a condition where there is reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, often due to atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease. Acute Myocardial Infarction is a severe manifestation of ischemic heart disease, where there is a sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death. Therefore, if a person has Ischemic heart disease, they are at risk of developing Acute Myocardial Infarction. However, not everyone with Ischemic heart disease will necessarily have an acute heart attack."
Ventricular septal abnormality,40457757,False,"No

Rationale:
A ventricular septal abnormality refers to a defect in the septum that separates the left and right ventricles of the heart. While this condition can potentially lead to complications such as heart failure, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI is primarily caused by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis, rather than a structural defect in the heart. Therefore, having a ventricular septal abnormality does not definitively mean that an individual has experienced an AMI."
Sequelae of cardiovascular disorders,4176969,False,"No, the condition ""Sequelae of cardiovascular disorders"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

The term ""sequelae of cardiovascular disorders"" refers to the long-term consequences or complications that may arise as a result of various cardiovascular conditions, including but not limited to AMI. These sequelae can include conditions such as heart failure, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and others. 

While AMI can certainly lead to sequelae such as heart failure or arrhythmias, the presence of sequelae of cardiovascular disorders does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI. Therefore, the condition is not specific to the malady in question."
Occlusion of posterior descending branch of right coronary artery,3655759,False,"No

Rationale: While occlusion of the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery can contribute to the development of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to the malady. AMI can result from occlusion of any of the coronary arteries, not just the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery. Therefore, having this specific condition does not definitively mean that an individual has experienced an AMI."
Occlusion of marginal branch of right coronary artery,3655758,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the marginal branch of the right coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

In the description of AMI, it is mentioned that AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. The occlusion of the marginal branch of the right coronary artery would lead to a lack of blood flow to a portion of the myocardium, causing myocardial cell death and subsequent release of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin, which are indicative of AMI. 

Therefore, if a person has the condition of occlusion of the marginal branch of the right coronary artery, they would definitely have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Occlusion of mid portion of right coronary artery,3655757,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the mid portion of the right coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). In the description of AMI, it is mentioned that AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. The right coronary artery is one of the main arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle, and occlusion of this artery can lead to AMI. Therefore, if a person has an occlusion of the mid portion of the right coronary artery, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Occlusion of distal portion of right coronary artery,3655756,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the distal portion of the right coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). In AMI, the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leads to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, resulting in a heart attack. If there is an occlusion of the distal portion of the right coronary artery, it can lead to a heart attack involving that area of the heart supplied by this artery. Therefore, if someone has an occlusion in this specific location, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Chronic total occlusion of coronary artery,36712779,False,"No, chronic total occlusion of a coronary artery is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While chronic total occlusion of a coronary artery can increase the risk of developing a heart attack, it does not definitively indicate the presence of an acute myocardial infarction. Other factors such as the extent of collateral circulation, the presence of other risk factors, and the overall health of the individual also play a role in determining whether an acute myocardial infarction occurs. Therefore, the presence of chronic total occlusion of a coronary artery does not guarantee the presence of an acute myocardial infarction."
Occlusion of proximal portion of right coronary artery,3655755,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the proximal portion of the right coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). In the description of AMI, it is mentioned that AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. The right coronary artery is one of the main arteries that supply blood to the heart, and occlusion of this artery can lead to AMI. Therefore, if a person has an occlusion of the proximal portion of the right coronary artery, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Rupture of papillary muscle as current complication following acute myocardial infarction,4108220,True,"Yes, the condition ""Rupture of papillary muscle as current complication following acute myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rupture of the papillary muscle is a serious complication that can occur following an acute myocardial infarction. The papillary muscles are responsible for anchoring the mitral valve leaflets in the heart, and if they rupture, it can lead to acute mitral regurgitation, which can be life-threatening. This complication is directly related to the initial event of acute myocardial infarction, as the ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue can weaken the papillary muscles and lead to their rupture. Therefore, if a patient has experienced a rupture of the papillary muscle as a current complication following an acute myocardial infarction, it is a clear indication that they have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia,37309626,False,"No

Rationale: Myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia is a specific type of myocardial infarction that occurs when there is an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, leading to ischemia and subsequent infarction. This condition is a subset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), as it falls under the broader category of heart attacks. Therefore, if a person has myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia, they definitely have AMI. However, not all cases of AMI are specifically due to demand ischemia, as there are other causes such as plaque rupture or coronary artery spasm."
Subsequent myocardial infarction of inferior wall,4108218,True,"Yes, the condition of subsequent myocardial infarction of the inferior wall is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Rationale: The condition of subsequent myocardial infarction of the inferior wall specifically refers to a subsequent occurrence of a heart attack affecting the inferior wall of the heart. Since AMI is defined as the abrupt interruption of blood flow to a portion of the myocardium resulting in myocardial cell death, a subsequent myocardial infarction of the inferior wall would fall under the umbrella of AMI. Therefore, if a patient has the condition of subsequent myocardial infarction of the inferior wall, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Rupture of chordae tendinae due to and following acute myocardial infarction,4108219,True,"Yes, the condition ""Rupture of chordae tendinae due to and following acute myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rupture of chordae tendinae is a complication that can occur following an acute myocardial infarction. The sudden occlusion of a coronary artery during a heart attack can lead to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, including the papillary muscles and chordae tendinae that support the mitral valve. This can result in the rupture of the chordae tendinae, leading to mitral regurgitation and subsequent symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and heart failure. 

Therefore, if a patient has experienced a rupture of chordae tendinae due to and following an acute myocardial infarction, it is highly likely that they have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction with papillary muscle and chordal rupture,45771327,True,"Yes, the condition of Mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction with papillary muscle and chordal rupture is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale: Mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction with papillary muscle and chordal rupture is a complication that can occur as a result of an acute myocardial infarction. The rupture of the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae can lead to the inability of the mitral valve to close properly, resulting in regurgitation of blood back into the left atrium. This complication is directly related to the occurrence of an acute myocardial infarction, as the ischemic damage to the heart muscle can affect the structures supporting the mitral valve. Therefore, if a patient presents with this specific condition, it is highly likely that they have also experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
True posterior myocardial infarction,439693,True,"Yes, the condition of true posterior myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). A true posterior myocardial infarction refers to the occlusion of the posterior descending artery, which supplies the posterior wall of the heart. This specific type of myocardial infarction is a subset of AMI and is characterized by ECG changes that may not be as readily apparent as in other types of AMI. Therefore, if a patient is diagnosed with a true posterior myocardial infarction, they definitely have the broader malady of AMI."
Coronary artery graft present,42537730,False,"No

Rationale: The presence of a coronary artery graft does not definitively indicate the presence of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While a coronary artery graft may be used as a treatment option for patients with coronary artery disease to improve blood flow to the heart muscle, it does not necessarily mean that the patient has experienced a heart attack. AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which may or may not be present in a patient with a coronary artery graft. Therefore, the condition of having a coronary artery graft is not specific to the malady of acute myocardial infarction."
Coronary arteriosclerosis,317576,True,"Yes, coronary arteriosclerosis is specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Coronary arteriosclerosis refers to the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can lead to narrowing or blockage of these vessels. This narrowing or blockage is what ultimately causes the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery in AMI, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. Therefore, if someone has coronary arteriosclerosis, they are at an increased risk of developing AMI."
Occlusion of distal left anterior descending coronary artery,3654821,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). The left anterior descending coronary artery is a major artery that supplies blood to a significant portion of the heart muscle. If this artery becomes occluded, it can lead to a heart attack (AMI) due to the sudden interruption of blood flow to the myocardium. Therefore, if a patient has an occlusion of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Occlusion of mid left anterior descending coronary artery,3654820,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). The mid left anterior descending coronary artery is a major branch of the left coronary artery that supplies blood to a significant portion of the heart muscle. If this artery becomes occluded, it can lead to a heart attack (AMI) by causing ischemia and necrosis of the cardiac tissue supplied by this artery. Therefore, if a person has an occlusion of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery, they definitely have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Occlusion of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery,3654819,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). The left anterior descending coronary artery is a major artery that supplies a significant portion of the heart muscle, and occlusion of this artery can lead to a heart attack. In the description of AMI, it is mentioned that AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, which can result in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. Therefore, if a patient has an occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, they are at high risk for developing AMI."
Chronic pulmonary edema,4188331,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic pulmonary edema is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema due to heart failure, chronic pulmonary edema can have various causes such as congestive heart failure, chronic lung diseases, or kidney disorders. Therefore, having chronic pulmonary edema does not definitively indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
ST segment elevation,4295129,True,"Yes, ST segment elevation is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). ST segment elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a classic finding in AMI and is one of the criteria used to diagnose this condition. It indicates myocardial injury and ischemia, which are characteristic features of a heart attack. Therefore, if a patient presents with ST segment elevation, it strongly suggests the presence of AMI."
Toxic nephropathy,4126119,False,"No

Rationale:
Toxic nephropathy refers to kidney damage caused by exposure to toxic substances such as medications, chemicals, or heavy metals. While toxic nephropathy can lead to various complications, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. The two conditions involve different organ systems and pathophysiological processes. Therefore, having toxic nephropathy does not definitively indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
Atrial septal defect due to and following acute myocardial infarction,438172,False,"No

Rationale: Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormal opening in the septum between the atria. It is not typically associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which is caused by coronary artery occlusion leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis. While it is possible for a patient with AMI to develop complications such as ventricular septal defect (VSD) due to myocardial infarction, ASD is not a common complication of AMI. Therefore, the presence of ASD following AMI is not specific to the malady of acute myocardial infarction."
Ventricular aneurysm due to and following acute myocardial infarction,37109910,True,"Yes, the condition of ventricular aneurysm due to and following acute myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

A ventricular aneurysm is a complication that can occur following an acute myocardial infarction, where a portion of the heart muscle becomes weakened and bulges outwards. This is a direct consequence of the ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue that occurs during a heart attack. Therefore, if a patient has a ventricular aneurysm due to and following an acute myocardial infarction, it is a clear indication that they have experienced an acute myocardial infarction. 

In contrast, not all patients who have an acute myocardial infarction will develop a ventricular aneurysm, as it is a specific complication that may or may not occur following the initial event."
Pulmonary embolism due to and following acute myocardial infarction,37109911,True,"Yes, the condition ""Pulmonary embolism due to and following acute myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady ""Acute Myocardial Infarction."" 

Rationale:
Pulmonary embolism is a known complication that can occur following an acute myocardial infarction. The occlusion of a coronary artery during a heart attack can lead to the formation of blood clots, which can then travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism. Therefore, if a patient has a pulmonary embolism due to and following an acute myocardial infarction, it is highly likely that they have experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure,46271075,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by a low oxygen level in the blood, which can be caused by various underlying conditions such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism, or heart failure. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to complications such as cardiogenic shock or pulmonary edema, it is not a specific condition associated with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Therefore, having acute hypoxemic respiratory failure does not definitively mean that a person has acute myocardial infarction."
Preinfarction syndrome,315296,False,"No, preinfarction syndrome is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Preinfarction syndrome refers to a set of symptoms that may occur before a heart attack, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. While these symptoms can be indicative of an impending heart attack, they are not exclusive to AMI and can also be present in other cardiac conditions or even non-cardiac issues. Therefore, having preinfarction syndrome does not definitively mean that a person will have an AMI, as these symptoms can be seen in a variety of medical conditions."
Cardiogenic shock,198571,True,"Yes

Rationale:
Cardiogenic shock is a specific complication that can occur as a result of an acute myocardial infarction. When a patient experiences an acute myocardial infarction, the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery can lead to significant damage to the heart muscle, resulting in decreased cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion. This can ultimately progress to cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe hypotension, decreased organ perfusion, and signs of end-organ dysfunction. Therefore, if a patient has cardiogenic shock, it is highly likely that they are experiencing or have recently experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Occlusion of septal branch of anterior descending branch of left coronary artery,3655070,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the septal branch of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

The septal branch of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery supplies blood to the septum of the heart. If this branch becomes occluded, it can lead to ischemia and necrosis of the cardiac tissue, which is a hallmark of AMI. The sudden interruption of blood flow to this area can result in myocardial cell death and the release of cardiac biomarkers, such as troponin, which are indicative of AMI.

Therefore, if a patient has the condition of occlusion of the septal branch of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery, it is highly likely that they have also experienced an AMI."
Left coronary artery occlusion,4048534,True,"Yes, left coronary artery occlusion is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). The left coronary artery supplies blood to a significant portion of the heart, including the left ventricle, which is crucial for cardiac function. If there is an occlusion in the left coronary artery, it can lead to a sudden interruption of blood flow to the myocardium, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, which is characteristic of AMI. Therefore, if a patient has left coronary artery occlusion, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Arrhythmia due to and following acute myocardial infarction,37109912,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arrhythmia due to and following acute myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady ""Acute Myocardial Infarction.""

Rationale:
Arrhythmias are a common complication following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to the disruption of the heart's electrical conduction system caused by the ischemic damage to the myocardium. Therefore, if a patient has an arrhythmia specifically due to and following an AMI, it is highly likely that they have experienced an AMI. Additionally, the presence of an arrhythmia following an AMI is a significant clinical finding that is often used to monitor and manage patients with AMI."
Post-infarction ventricular septal defect,4119953,True,"Yes, the condition of post-infarction ventricular septal defect is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

A post-infarction ventricular septal defect is a complication that can occur following an AMI, where there is a rupture in the septum between the ventricles of the heart due to the necrosis of cardiac tissue. This condition is directly related to the occurrence of an AMI, as the initial heart attack leads to the development of the ventricular septal defect. Therefore, if a patient is diagnosed with a post-infarction ventricular septal defect, it is certain that they have experienced an AMI."
"Thrombosis of atrium, auricular appendage, and ventricle due to and following acute myocardial infarction",4108680,True,"Yes

Rationale: Thrombosis of the atrium, auricular appendage, and ventricle following an acute myocardial infarction is a specific condition that is directly related to the malady of acute myocardial infarction. The occlusion of a coronary artery during a heart attack can lead to the formation of blood clots within the heart chambers, which can subsequently cause thrombosis in the atrium, auricular appendage, and ventricle. Therefore, if a patient has thrombosis in these areas following an acute myocardial infarction, it is highly likely that they have experienced a heart attack."
Hemopericardium due to and following acute myocardial infarction,4108678,True,"Yes, the condition of Hemopericardium due to and following acute myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Hemopericardium refers to the accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. In the context of acute myocardial infarction, hemopericardium can occur as a complication of the heart attack due to the rupture of the myocardium or coronary artery, leading to bleeding into the pericardial space. This complication is directly related to the underlying pathology of acute myocardial infarction and is not typically seen in other conditions. Therefore, if a patient presents with hemopericardium following an acute myocardial infarction, it is highly indicative of the presence of the malady."
Rupture of cardiac wall without hemopericardium as current complication following acute myocardial infarction,4108679,True,"Yes, the condition ""Rupture of cardiac wall without hemopericardium as current complication following acute myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rupture of the cardiac wall is a serious complication that can occur following an acute myocardial infarction. The necrosis of cardiac tissue that occurs during a heart attack can weaken the heart muscle, leading to the potential for rupture of the cardiac wall. This complication is directly related to the initial event of acute myocardial infarction and is a known consequence of the ischemic damage to the heart tissue. Therefore, if a patient has experienced a rupture of the cardiac wall without hemopericardium following an acute myocardial infarction, it is a clear indication that they have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Subsequent myocardial infarction of anterior wall,4108677,True,"Yes, the condition of subsequent myocardial infarction of the anterior wall is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale: The condition specifically mentions a subsequent myocardial infarction of the anterior wall, which indicates a recurrent heart attack affecting the front portion of the heart. Since Acute Myocardial Infarction is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, a subsequent myocardial infarction of the anterior wall would be a direct consequence of the initial heart attack. Therefore, if a person has the condition of subsequent myocardial infarction of the anterior wall, they definitely have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Post infarct angina,4198141,True,"Yes, post infarct angina is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Post infarct angina refers to recurrent episodes of chest pain or discomfort that occur after a myocardial infarction. It is a common complication of AMI and is typically caused by ongoing ischemia in the myocardium due to underlying coronary artery disease. Therefore, if a patient has post infarct angina, it is highly likely that they have previously experienced an AMI."
Mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction,606159,True,"Yes, the condition of mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Mitral valve regurgitation can occur as a complication of acute myocardial infarction due to the damage to the heart muscle and the papillary muscles that support the mitral valve. This can lead to the improper closure of the mitral valve, causing blood to flow back into the left atrium during systole. 

Therefore, if a patient has mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction, it is highly likely that they have experienced an acute myocardial infarction. However, not all patients with acute myocardial infarction will develop mitral valve regurgitation, as it is a potential complication rather than a universal symptom."
Subendocardial myocardial infarction,765132,True,"Yes, the condition of subendocardial myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Subendocardial myocardial infarction refers to a type of heart attack that affects the innermost layer of the heart muscle. Since it is a type of myocardial infarction, if a person has a subendocardial myocardial infarction, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Disorder of cardiovascular prostheses and implants,142026,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of cardiovascular prostheses and implants"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction. While individuals with a history of cardiovascular prostheses or implants may be at an increased risk for developing heart-related conditions such as AMI, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI. AMI is specifically characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which is not directly related to the presence of cardiovascular prostheses or implants. Therefore, the condition is not specific to the malady."
Subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction of inferior wall,45773170,True,"Yes, the condition of subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction of the inferior wall is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Rationale: The condition specifically mentions a subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, which is a type of AMI characterized by ST segment elevation on ECG. Additionally, the mention of the inferior wall indicates the location of the myocardial infarction, which is a common site for AMI. Therefore, if a patient has a subsequent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction of the inferior wall, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Mural thrombus of right ventricle following acute myocardial infarction,42537536,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Mural thrombus of right ventricle following acute myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale: A mural thrombus is a blood clot that forms on the wall of a blood vessel or the heart. In the context of acute myocardial infarction, the occlusion of a coronary artery can lead to the formation of a mural thrombus in the right ventricle due to the disruption of blood flow. Therefore, if a patient has a mural thrombus in the right ventricle following an acute myocardial infarction, it is highly likely that they have experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Acute renal failure syndrome,197320,False,"No, acute renal failure syndrome is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While acute renal failure can occur as a complication of acute myocardial infarction due to decreased cardiac output and subsequent renal hypoperfusion, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Acute renal failure can also be caused by a variety of other factors such as dehydration, sepsis, medication toxicity, or urinary tract obstruction. Therefore, the presence of acute renal failure syndrome does not definitively indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
Right ventricular abnormality,4101621,False,"No, a right ventricular abnormality is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While AMI can lead to right ventricular involvement due to the close proximity of the right coronary artery to the right ventricle, a right ventricular abnormality can be caused by various other conditions such as pulmonary hypertension, congenital heart defects, or arrhythmias. Therefore, having a right ventricular abnormality does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure,44782718,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure is a condition characterized by both impaired contraction (systolic dysfunction) and impaired relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) of the heart muscle, leading to inadequate pumping of blood and fluid accumulation in the body. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to heart failure as a complication, not all cases of acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure are specifically caused by an acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, having acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that the individual has had an acute myocardial infarction."
Subsequent non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction,45766241,True,"Yes, the condition of subsequent non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale: Subsequent non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction refers to a recurrent heart attack that does not present with ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography. Since it is a type of myocardial infarction, it is directly related to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. If a patient has subsequent non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, they definitely have experienced a heart attack, which falls under the umbrella of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Acute pulmonary edema,261600,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute pulmonary edema is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While acute pulmonary edema can be a complication of AMI due to heart failure resulting from myocardial damage, it can also be caused by other conditions such as heart failure, pneumonia, or kidney failure. Therefore, the presence of acute pulmonary edema does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Occlusion of intermediate artery,3655134,False,"No, the condition ""Occlusion of intermediate artery"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial infarction, the occlusion of an intermediate artery does not necessarily indicate a heart attack. The occlusion of an intermediate artery could potentially lead to other conditions such as ischemia in different organs or tissues, depending on the location of the artery. Therefore, the presence of occlusion of an intermediate artery does not definitively mean that the individual has AMI."
Heart failure,316139,False,"No

Rationale: Heart failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While AMI can lead to heart failure as a complication due to the damage to the myocardium, heart failure can have various causes such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has had an acute myocardial infarction."
Occlusion of diagonal branch of anterior descending branch of left coronary artery,3655128,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the diagonal branch of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). In AMI, the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leads to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, which can occur in any branch of the coronary arteries, including the diagonal branch of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. This occlusion results in myocardial cell death and the release of cardiac biomarkers, which are characteristic features of AMI. Therefore, if a patient has the condition of occlusion of this specific coronary artery branch, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Right coronary artery occlusion,4046022,True,"Yes, right coronary artery occlusion is specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In the description of AMI provided, it is mentioned that AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, which can lead to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. The right coronary artery is one of the main arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle, and occlusion of this artery can result in AMI. Therefore, if a person has right coronary artery occlusion, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction without papillary muscle and chordal rupture,45766214,True,"Yes, the condition of Mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction without papillary muscle and chordal rupture is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Mitral valve regurgitation can occur as a complication of acute myocardial infarction due to the damage to the heart muscle and subsequent dysfunction of the mitral valve. In this case, the regurgitation is directly related to the heart attack and its effects on the heart's structure and function. Therefore, if a patient has Mitral valve regurgitation due to acute myocardial infarction without papillary muscle and chordal rupture, they definitely have experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
