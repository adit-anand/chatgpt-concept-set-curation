Post-infarction mural thrombus,4119606,True,"Yes, post-infarction mural thrombus is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

A post-infarction mural thrombus refers to a blood clot that forms on the damaged heart muscle following a heart attack. This condition is directly related to the pathophysiology of AMI, where the occlusion of a coronary artery leads to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. The formation of a thrombus in the area of myocardial infarction is a common complication of AMI and can increase the risk of further cardiovascular events such as stroke or pulmonary embolism. Therefore, if a patient has a post-infarction mural thrombus, it is highly likely that they have experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Aneurysm of coronary vessels,316427,False,"No, an aneurysm of coronary vessels is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While an aneurysm of coronary vessels can be a complication of AMI, it can also occur due to other conditions such as atherosclerosis, connective tissue disorders, or infections. Therefore, having an aneurysm of coronary vessels does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Post-infarction hemopericardium,4119597,True,"Yes, post-infarction hemopericardium is specific to acute myocardial infarction. 

Post-infarction hemopericardium refers to the accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac following a myocardial infarction. This condition is a complication of acute myocardial infarction and occurs due to the rupture of the myocardium or a ventricular wall, leading to bleeding into the pericardial space. Therefore, if a patient has post-infarction hemopericardium, it is indicative of a prior acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, not all patients with acute myocardial infarction will develop post-infarction hemopericardium, as it is a specific complication rather than a universal feature of the disease."
Stable angina due to coronary arteriosclerosis,37209632,False,"No

Rationale: Stable angina due to coronary arteriosclerosis is a chronic condition characterized by predictable chest pain or discomfort that occurs with exertion or emotional stress and is relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. It is caused by partial obstruction of coronary arteries due to arteriosclerosis, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. While stable angina is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), not all individuals with stable angina will go on to have a heart attack. Therefore, having stable angina due to coronary arteriosclerosis does not definitively mean that an individual will have an acute myocardial infarction."
Myocardial infarction due to atherothrombotic coronary artery disease,604179,True,"Yes, the condition ""Myocardial infarction due to atherothrombotic coronary artery disease"" is specific to the malady ""Acute Myocardial Infarction."" 

The condition specifically mentions the cause of the myocardial infarction being atherothrombotic coronary artery disease, which is a common underlying pathology leading to acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, if a person has this condition, they definitely have experienced an acute myocardial infarction. However, not all cases of acute myocardial infarction are due to atherothrombotic coronary artery disease, as there are other potential causes such as coronary artery spasm or embolism."
TIMI grade 3: complete perfusion,4161570,True,"Yes, the condition of TIMI grade 3: complete perfusion is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

The Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grading system is used to assess the degree of coronary artery perfusion after a heart attack. A TIMI grade of 3 indicates complete perfusion of the affected coronary artery, which is a positive outcome following reperfusion therapy in the setting of AMI. Therefore, if a patient has TIMI grade 3 complete perfusion, it is highly indicative of AMI. However, it is important to note that not all patients with AMI will achieve TIMI grade 3, as this depends on various factors such as the extent of myocardial damage and the timeliness of intervention."
Single coronary vessel disease,4111393,True,"Yes, the condition of single coronary vessel disease is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale: Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) is caused by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, leading to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. Single coronary vessel disease refers to the presence of significant blockage or narrowing in one of the coronary arteries supplying blood to the heart. If a person has single coronary vessel disease, they are at increased risk of developing AMI if the blockage progresses to the point of causing a complete occlusion of the artery. Therefore, the presence of single coronary vessel disease is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Angina co-occurrent and due to coronary arteriosclerosis,36712983,True,"Yes, the condition ""Angina co-occurrent and due to coronary arteriosclerosis"" is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Angina pectoris is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough blood flow, typically due to coronary artery disease (coronary arteriosclerosis). In the context of AMI, angina can be a warning sign of an impending heart attack. When angina is co-occurrent and due to coronary arteriosclerosis, it indicates that the underlying cause of the chest pain is related to atherosclerotic plaque buildup in the coronary arteries, which can lead to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery and result in an acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, if a person has angina co-occurrent and due to coronary arteriosclerosis, they are at high risk for developing AMI."
Cardiac arrest due to cardiac disorder,4172822,True,"Yes, the condition ""Cardiac arrest due to cardiac disorder"" is specific to the malady Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Cardiac arrest is a sudden loss of heart function, breathing, and consciousness, often caused by an underlying cardiac disorder such as AMI. In the case of AMI, the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leads to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, which can result in cardiac arrest. Therefore, if a person experiences cardiac arrest due to a cardiac disorder, it is highly likely that the underlying cause is an acute myocardial infarction."
Heart disease,321588,False,"No, the condition ""heart disease"" is not specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Heart disease is a broad term that encompasses a range of conditions affecting the heart, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and more. While AMI is a type of heart disease, not all heart disease conditions involve the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial infarction. Therefore, having heart disease does not definitively mean that an individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Silent myocardial infarction,4124686,True,"Yes, the condition of silent myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Silent myocardial infarction refers to a heart attack that occurs without the typical symptoms of chest pain or discomfort. It is often diagnosed incidentally on an electrocardiogram (ECG) or imaging study performed for other reasons. However, despite the absence of symptoms, silent myocardial infarctions still result in myocardial cell death and can lead to complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias. 

Since silent myocardial infarctions are a subtype of acute myocardial infarction, if a person has a silent myocardial infarction, they definitely have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. On the other hand, not all cases of Acute Myocardial Infarction may present as silent, as many individuals experience the classic symptoms of chest pain or discomfort."
Acquired ventricular septal defect,42536633,False,"No

Rationale: Acquired ventricular septal defect is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While a ventricular septal defect can occur as a complication of a heart attack due to the necrosis of cardiac tissue, it can also be caused by other factors such as infective endocarditis, trauma, or certain medical procedures. Therefore, the presence of an acquired ventricular septal defect does not definitively indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
Triple vessel disease of the heart,4124682,True,"Yes, triple vessel disease of the heart is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Triple vessel disease refers to the presence of significant blockages in all three major coronary arteries supplying blood to the heart. This condition increases the risk of developing acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) as it can lead to severe ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. Therefore, if a person has triple vessel disease of the heart, they are at a higher risk of experiencing an acute myocardial infarction. However, not all individuals with acute myocardial infarction will necessarily have triple vessel disease, as there are other causes of heart attacks such as plaque rupture in a single coronary artery."
ECG: no myocardial infarction,4065281,False,"No, the condition ""ECG: no myocardial infarction"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While the absence of ECG findings indicative of myocardial infarction can rule out AMI as a diagnosis, it does not definitively confirm the absence of the condition. Other diagnostic criteria such as clinical history and cardiac biomarkers are also essential in determining the presence of AMI. Therefore, the condition alone does not guarantee the absence of AMI."
Ventricular tachycardia,4103295,False,"No, ventricular tachycardia is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Ventricular tachycardia is a rapid heart rhythm originating from the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) and can be caused by various underlying conditions such as structural heart disease, electrolyte imbalances, or certain medications. While ventricular tachycardia can occur as a complication of AMI due to the damage to the heart muscle, it is not exclusive to AMI and can occur in other cardiac conditions as well. Therefore, having ventricular tachycardia does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Dilated cardiomyopathy,4163710,False,"No

Rationale: Dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition characterized by the enlargement of the heart chambers and impaired systolic function, leading to decreased cardiac output. While dilated cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure and potentially increase the risk of a heart attack, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. There are various causes of dilated cardiomyopathy, including genetic factors, infections, toxins, and autoimmune diseases, which can result in heart failure without the presence of an acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, having dilated cardiomyopathy does not definitively mean that an individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Coronary arteriosclerosis following coronary artery bypass graft,37016181,False,"No

Rationale: Coronary arteriosclerosis following coronary artery bypass graft is a condition where there is a buildup of plaque in the arteries that have been surgically bypassed. While this condition may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which is not necessarily directly related to the presence of coronary arteriosclerosis following bypass graft. Therefore, having coronary arteriosclerosis following coronary artery bypass graft does not definitively mean that a person has or will have an AMI."
Acute infarction of papillary muscle,4011131,False,"No

Rationale: Acute infarction of the papillary muscle is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While it can be a complication of AMI, it can also occur in other conditions such as myocarditis, endocarditis, or coronary artery disease without AMI. Therefore, having acute infarction of the papillary muscle does not definitively mean that the individual has AMI."
Postoperative myocardial infarction,4030582,True,"Yes, postoperative myocardial infarction is specific to acute myocardial infarction. 

Postoperative myocardial infarction refers to a heart attack that occurs after a surgical procedure. In this context, the condition is a subset of acute myocardial infarction, as it involves the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. Therefore, if a patient experiences postoperative myocardial infarction, they definitely have the malady of acute myocardial infarction."
Early postmyocardial infarction pericarditis,37311079,False,"No

Rationale:
Early postmyocardial infarction pericarditis is a specific condition that occurs following a myocardial infarction, characterized by inflammation of the pericardium. While it is associated with a recent heart attack, not all patients who have had a heart attack will develop pericarditis. Therefore, having early postmyocardial infarction pericarditis does not definitively mean that the individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Delayed postmyocardial infarction pericarditis,37311078,False,"No

Rationale:
Delayed postmyocardial infarction pericarditis is a specific condition that occurs after a myocardial infarction, but not all individuals who have had a heart attack will develop this complication. Therefore, having delayed postmyocardial infarction pericarditis does not definitively mean that an individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
EKG: old myocardial infarction,4064348,True,"Yes, the condition ""EKG: old myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

An EKG showing evidence of an old myocardial infarction indicates that the patient has previously experienced a heart attack, which is a key feature of AMI. The presence of old myocardial infarction on an EKG suggests that there has been prior damage to the heart muscle due to a previous episode of AMI. Therefore, if a patient has the condition ""EKG: old myocardial infarction,"" it is highly likely that they have or have had Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Pulmonary embolism,440417,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary embolism is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While both conditions can present with chest pain and shortness of breath, they are distinct entities with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Pulmonary embolism is characterized by a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries, typically caused by a blood clot that has traveled from another part of the body. Diagnosis is confirmed by imaging studies such as CT pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan, along with clinical assessment and laboratory tests. Treatment involves anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clot formation and reduce the risk of complications. While pulmonary embolism can sometimes be a complication of acute myocardial infarction, it is not a specific condition that always accompanies AMI."
Subacute ischemic heart disease,37017177,False,"No

Rationale:
Subacute ischemic heart disease is a condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, which can lead to ischemia but may not necessarily result in a heart attack (AMI). While subacute ischemic heart disease may be a precursor to AMI if left untreated, it is not specific to AMI as there are other potential outcomes and complications associated with reduced blood flow to the heart. Therefore, having subacute ischemic heart disease does not definitively mean that an individual will have an acute myocardial infarction."
Pleural effusion,254061,False,"No

Rationale: Pleural effusion is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Pleural effusion is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which can be caused by various conditions such as congestive heart failure, pneumonia, malignancy, or liver disease. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to complications such as heart failure, which may manifest as pleural effusion, the presence of pleural effusion alone does not definitively indicate acute myocardial infarction. Additional diagnostic criteria specific to AMI, such as ECG changes and elevated cardiac biomarkers, are necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
Fear of heart attack,4012109,False,"No, the condition ""Fear of heart attack"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While fear of having a heart attack may be a common concern for individuals, it is a psychological response rather than a definitive indicator of the presence of AMI. AMI is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, ECG findings, and cardiac biomarkers, rather than subjective feelings of fear. Therefore, having a fear of a heart attack does not necessarily mean that an individual has AMI."
Ventricular septal abnormality,40457757,False,"No

Rationale: A ventricular septal abnormality refers to a defect in the septum that separates the left and right ventricles of the heart. While this condition can potentially lead to complications such as increased risk of infection, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI is specifically related to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which is not directly caused by a ventricular septal abnormality. Therefore, having a ventricular septal abnormality does not definitively mean that an individual has AMI."
Progression of coronary arteriosclerosis,1340513,False,"No

Rationale: The progression of coronary arteriosclerosis is a condition that refers to the gradual buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries over time, leading to narrowing and potential blockages. While coronary arteriosclerosis is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI. Many individuals with coronary arteriosclerosis may not experience a heart attack, as other factors such as plaque stability, rupture, and thrombosis play a role in the development of AMI. Therefore, the presence of the condition does not necessarily mean the individual has the malady."
Sequelae of cardiovascular disorders,4176969,False,"No, the condition ""Sequelae of cardiovascular disorders"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

The term ""sequelae of cardiovascular disorders"" refers to the long-term consequences or complications that may arise as a result of various cardiovascular conditions, including AMI. While AMI can certainly lead to sequelae such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock, the presence of sequelae alone does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI. 

Therefore, individuals with sequelae of cardiovascular disorders may or may not have had a previous episode of AMI. The presence of sequelae could be due to other cardiovascular conditions or risk factors as well."
Occlusion of posterior descending branch of right coronary artery,3655759,True,"Yes, the condition of occlusion of the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

In AMI, the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leads to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, resulting in a heart attack. The posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery is one of the arteries that can become occluded during an AMI, leading to myocardial cell death and subsequent release of cardiac biomarkers. Therefore, if a person has an occlusion of the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Atrial thrombosis,4108352,False,"No

Rationale:
Atrial thrombosis is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While atrial thrombosis can be a complication of AMI due to the formation of blood clots in the atria as a result of decreased cardiac output and stasis of blood flow, it can also occur in other conditions such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and valvular heart disease. Therefore, having atrial thrombosis does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Injury of intrathoracic organ,37116489,False,"No, the condition ""Injury of intrathoracic organ"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While an injury of an intrathoracic organ could potentially lead to complications that may mimic symptoms of AMI, it is not a definitive indicator of the malady. AMI is specifically related to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which is not directly related to an injury of an intrathoracic organ. Additional diagnostic criteria such as ECG findings and cardiac biomarkers are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of AMI."
Intraventricular conduction defect,4166844,False,"No, the condition of intraventricular conduction defect is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Intraventricular conduction defect refers to abnormalities in the electrical conduction within the ventricles of the heart, which can be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG) as widened QRS complexes. While intraventricular conduction defects can be present in patients with AMI, they are not exclusive to this condition. Intraventricular conduction defects can also be seen in other cardiac conditions such as bundle branch blocks, cardiomyopathies, and electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, the presence of an intraventricular conduction defect does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Myocardial necrosis,4354249,True,"Yes, myocardial necrosis is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Myocardial necrosis refers to the death of cardiac tissue, which is a hallmark feature of AMI. In AMI, the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leads to ischemia and subsequent necrosis of myocardial cells, resulting in the release of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin. Therefore, if a patient has myocardial necrosis, it is highly indicative of AMI."
Chronic pulmonary edema,4188331,False,"No, chronic pulmonary edema is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Chronic pulmonary edema is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the lungs over a prolonged period of time, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema due to heart failure, chronic pulmonary edema can have various causes including heart failure, kidney disease, and lung conditions. Therefore, the presence of chronic pulmonary edema does not definitively indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
Supraventricular tachycardia,4275423,False,"No

Rationale:
Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a condition characterized by a rapid heart rate originating above the ventricles, typically in the atria. While SVT can be a symptom or a sign of various cardiac conditions, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to AMI. SVT can occur in the absence of AMI and can be caused by other factors such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or accessory pathways. Therefore, having SVT does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure,46271075,False,"No

Rationale: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by a low oxygen level in the blood, which can be caused by various underlying conditions such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism, or heart failure. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to complications such as cardiogenic shock or pulmonary edema, it is not a specific condition that is always present in cases of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Therefore, the presence of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure does not definitively indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
Arteriosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft,443563,False,"No, arteriosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While arteriosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft can contribute to the development of coronary artery disease and potentially increase the risk of a heart attack, it is not a definitive indicator of an acute myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction is typically diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, ECG findings, and cardiac biomarkers, rather than solely on the presence of arteriosclerosis in a specific location. Therefore, having arteriosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft does not necessarily mean that an individual definitely has had or will have an acute myocardial infarction."
Biventricular congestive heart failure,4242669,True,"Yes, biventricular congestive heart failure is specific to acute myocardial infarction. 

Biventricular congestive heart failure refers to the inability of both the left and right ventricles of the heart to pump effectively, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and other parts of the body. Acute myocardial infarction can cause significant damage to the heart muscle, leading to impaired ventricular function and ultimately resulting in heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has biventricular congestive heart failure, it is highly likely that it is a consequence of an acute myocardial infarction."
Calcific coronary arteriosclerosis,4242670,True,"Yes, calcific coronary arteriosclerosis is specific to acute myocardial infarction. 

Calcific coronary arteriosclerosis refers to the buildup of calcium deposits in the coronary arteries, which can lead to atherosclerosis and ultimately result in the occlusion of a coronary artery, causing ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. This process is a major risk factor for acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, if an individual has calcific coronary arteriosclerosis, they are at a higher risk of experiencing a heart attack. However, not everyone with calcific coronary arteriosclerosis will necessarily have an acute myocardial infarction, as other factors such as plaque rupture or thrombosis may also contribute to the development of a heart attack."
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to coronary artery disease,45766165,True,"Yes, the condition of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to coronary artery disease is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).

Rationale:
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to coronary artery disease is a condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively due to damage from coronary artery disease, which can lead to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In this case, the presence of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to coronary artery disease would indicate a history of coronary artery disease and potentially a previous AMI. Therefore, if a patient has this specific condition, they definitely have a history of AMI. However, not all patients with AMI will develop heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, as the extent of myocardial damage and other factors can influence the development of heart failure."
Arteriosclerosis of autologous arterial coronary artery bypass graft,43021857,True,"Yes, arteriosclerosis of autologous arterial coronary artery bypass graft is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Arteriosclerosis refers to the thickening and hardening of the walls of arteries, which can lead to reduced blood flow. In the context of an autologous arterial coronary artery bypass graft, this condition specifically affects the graft that was created to bypass a blocked coronary artery. If arteriosclerosis develops in the bypass graft, it can lead to a recurrence of ischemia and potentially result in another heart attack (AMI). Therefore, if a patient has arteriosclerosis of an autologous arterial coronary artery bypass graft, they are at increased risk for AMI."
Inferior myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram,4247796,True,"Yes, the condition ""Inferior myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram"" is specific to the malady ""Acute Myocardial Infarction."" 

An inferior myocardial infarction on an electrocardiogram (ECG) indicates that there is ischemia or necrosis in the inferior wall of the heart, which is a common location for myocardial infarctions to occur. In the context of the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction, an ECG showing an inferior myocardial infarction would be consistent with the diagnosis, as it is one of the criteria used to confirm the presence of a heart attack. Therefore, if a patient has an inferior myocardial infarction on an ECG, they definitely have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Cardiogenic shock following procedure,3656846,False,"No

Rationale: While cardiogenic shock can be a complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to AMI. Cardiogenic shock can also occur following other cardiac procedures or conditions such as severe heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmias. Therefore, the presence of cardiogenic shock following a procedure does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Systolic heart failure,443580,False,"No

Rationale: Systolic heart failure is a condition characterized by the inability of the heart to pump effectively, leading to reduced ejection fraction and cardiac output. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to systolic heart failure as a complication, not all cases of systolic heart failure are specifically due to acute myocardial infarction. Systolic heart failure can have various causes, including chronic hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies, among others. Therefore, having systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that the individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Impending infarction,4096252,False,"No

Rationale:
Impending infarction is a term used to describe a situation where there are signs and symptoms suggesting that a myocardial infarction (heart attack) may occur in the near future. It is not a specific condition that definitively indicates the presence of an acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, having the condition of impending infarction does not necessarily mean that one definitely has an acute myocardial infarction. It is more of a warning sign that further evaluation and monitoring are needed to determine if a heart attack is imminent."
Mixed acid-base balance disorder,441536,False,"No

Rationale:
A mixed acid-base balance disorder is a general term that encompasses various disturbances in the body's pH levels, including metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. While these disturbances can occur in a variety of medical conditions, they are not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI is specifically characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis, which does not directly cause a mixed acid-base balance disorder. Therefore, having a mixed acid-base balance disorder does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Acute heart disease,4132088,False,"No, the condition ""Acute heart disease"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Acute heart disease is a broad term that can encompass various acute cardiac conditions, including AMI, but also other conditions such as acute heart failure, acute myocarditis, or acute pericarditis. Therefore, having the condition of ""Acute heart disease"" does not definitively mean that the individual has AMI specifically. Additional diagnostic tests and clinical evaluation would be needed to confirm the presence of AMI in a patient presenting with acute heart disease symptoms."
Atherosclerosis of coronary artery without angina pectoris,764123,False,"No, atherosclerosis of the coronary artery without angina pectoris is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Atherosclerosis is a common underlying cause of AMI, as it leads to the formation of plaques in the coronary arteries that can rupture and cause a heart attack. However, not all cases of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries will necessarily result in an acute myocardial infarction. Angina pectoris, which is chest pain or discomfort due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, is a common symptom of atherosclerosis but may not always be present. Therefore, while atherosclerosis is a risk factor for AMI, it is not a definitive indicator of the condition."
Sequelae of disorders classified by disorder-system,4181217,False,"No, the condition ""Sequelae of disorders classified by disorder-system"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction. This condition refers to the long-term consequences or effects of a disorder classified by the system affected (e.g., cardiovascular system, respiratory system). While AMI can lead to various sequelae such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock, the presence of sequelae of disorders classified by disorder-system does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI. Additional diagnostic criteria specific to AMI, such as clinical history, ECG findings, and cardiac biomarkers, are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of a heart attack."
Necrosis of anatomical site,43530876,False,"No, necrosis of an anatomical site is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Necrosis can occur in various tissues and organs due to a variety of reasons, such as ischemia, infection, toxins, or trauma. While necrosis of cardiac tissue is a hallmark feature of AMI, it can also occur in other conditions unrelated to the heart. Therefore, the presence of necrosis of an anatomical site alone does not definitively indicate AMI. Additional clinical information and diagnostic criteria specific to AMI, as outlined in the description provided, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
Coronary artery occlusion due to neoplastic disease,45766238,False,"No

Rationale: While coronary artery occlusion can occur in the context of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to AMI. Coronary artery occlusion can also be caused by other conditions such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, or vasospasm. In the case of neoplastic disease causing coronary artery occlusion, it may lead to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, but it does not necessarily indicate the presence of AMI. Therefore, the condition of coronary artery occlusion due to neoplastic disease is not specific to the malady of AMI."
Shock,201965,False,"No, shock is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Shock is a state of inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery, which can be caused by a variety of conditions such as severe infections, severe bleeding, heart failure, or anaphylaxis. While shock can be a complication of AMI due to the decreased cardiac output resulting from myocardial damage, it is not specific to AMI and can occur in other medical conditions as well."
Coronary arteriosclerosis after percutaneous coronary angioplasty,46269996,False,"No, the condition ""Coronary arteriosclerosis after percutaneous coronary angioplasty"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While coronary arteriosclerosis can lead to AMI if it results in the occlusion of a coronary artery, it is not a definitive indicator of AMI. AMI is specifically characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, which may or may not be directly related to a history of percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Therefore, having coronary arteriosclerosis after percutaneous coronary angioplasty does not definitively mean that a person has or will have AMI."
Atrial cardiopathy,3655971,False,"No

Rationale:
Atrial cardiopathy is a term used to describe structural and functional changes in the atria that may predispose individuals to stroke or other cardiovascular events. While atrial cardiopathy may increase the risk of certain conditions such as atrial fibrillation and stroke, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI is primarily caused by coronary artery occlusion leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis, which is distinct from the changes seen in atrial cardiopathy. Therefore, having atrial cardiopathy does not definitively mean that an individual will have an AMI."
Cardiac arrest as a complication of care,4309332,False,"No

Rationale:
While cardiac arrest can be a complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to this malady. Cardiac arrest can occur due to various other causes such as arrhythmias, electrolyte imbalances, drug toxicity, or respiratory failure. Therefore, having cardiac arrest as a complication of care does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Ventricular septal defect,434462,False,"No

Rationale:
A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormal opening in the septum between the two ventricles of the heart. While VSD can lead to complications such as heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI is typically caused by a sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis, which is not directly related to the presence of a VSD. Therefore, having a VSD does not necessarily mean that an individual will have an AMI."
Myocardial ischemia,4186397,True,"Yes, myocardial ischemia is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Myocardial ischemia refers to inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle, which can lead to tissue damage if not promptly addressed. In the context of AMI, myocardial ischemia is the initial event that triggers the cascade of events leading to myocardial infarction. Therefore, if a person has myocardial ischemia, they are at risk of developing AMI. However, not all cases of myocardial ischemia progress to AMI, as timely intervention can prevent further damage."
Acute coronary syndrome,4215140,False,"No, acute coronary syndrome is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Acute coronary syndrome is a broader term that encompasses a spectrum of conditions ranging from unstable angina to non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). While acute myocardial infarction is a type of acute coronary syndrome, not all cases of acute coronary syndrome will necessarily progress to a heart attack. Therefore, having acute coronary syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual has acute myocardial infarction."
Arteriosclerosis of autologous vein coronary artery bypass graft,40482638,True,"Yes, arteriosclerosis of autologous vein coronary artery bypass graft is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Arteriosclerosis of autologous vein coronary artery bypass graft refers to the narrowing or hardening of the vein used in a coronary artery bypass graft procedure. This condition can lead to decreased blood flow to the heart muscle, which can result in ischemia and potentially contribute to the development of AMI. Therefore, if a patient has arteriosclerosis of their autologous vein coronary artery bypass graft, they are at an increased risk of experiencing AMI. However, not all patients with AMI will necessarily have this specific condition, as there are other factors that can contribute to the development of a heart attack."
Long QT syndrome,314664,False,"No, Long QT syndrome is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction. Long QT syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram, which can predispose individuals to life-threatening arrhythmias such as Torsades de Pointes and sudden cardiac death. While individuals with Long QT syndrome may be at risk for cardiac events, it is not directly related to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery seen in Acute Myocardial Infarction. Therefore, having Long QT syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual will have Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Acute systolic heart failure,40480603,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute systolic heart failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to acute systolic heart failure as a complication, there are other causes of acute systolic heart failure such as viral myocarditis, severe valvular heart disease, or acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure. Therefore, having acute systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that the individual has acute myocardial infarction."
Inferior and lateral ST segment elevation,45767560,True,"Yes, the condition of inferior and lateral ST segment elevation is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). In the description of AMI provided, it is mentioned that diagnosis is confirmed by electrocardiography (ECG) findings indicative of ST-segment elevation. The specific locations of ST segment elevation mentioned, such as inferior and lateral leads, are commonly associated with AMI involving the inferior or lateral walls of the heart. Therefore, if a patient presents with inferior and lateral ST segment elevation, it is highly indicative of AMI."
Obliterative coronary artery disease,4168972,True,"Yes, the condition of obliterative coronary artery disease is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Obliterative coronary artery disease refers to the progressive narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. This condition is a major risk factor for the development of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as it can lead to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. Therefore, if a person has obliterative coronary artery disease, they are at a higher risk of experiencing an acute myocardial infarction. However, not everyone with obliterative coronary artery disease will necessarily have an AMI, as other factors such as plaque stability, thrombus formation, and collateral circulation also play a role in the development of a heart attack."
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure,40480602,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure is a condition characterized by the acute decompensation of chronic heart failure, leading to worsening symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention. While acute on chronic systolic heart failure can increase the risk of developing complications such as acute myocardial infarction, it is not specific to the malady itself. Acute myocardial infarction is a distinct event involving the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which may or may not occur in the setting of chronic heart failure. Therefore, having acute on chronic systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that an individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Lateral ST segment elevation,45767554,False,"No

Rationale: Lateral ST segment elevation is a specific finding on an electrocardiogram (ECG) that can be indicative of myocardial infarction, but it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) alone. Lateral ST segment elevation can also be seen in other conditions such as pericarditis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and other cardiac abnormalities. Therefore, the presence of lateral ST segment elevation does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI. Additional clinical information and diagnostic tests would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of AMI."
Exacerbation of myocardial ischemia,766257,True,"Yes, exacerbation of myocardial ischemia is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Exacerbation of myocardial ischemia refers to a worsening or increase in the lack of oxygen supply to the heart muscle, which can lead to a heart attack (AMI). In the context of AMI, the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery results in severe myocardial ischemia, leading to necrosis of cardiac tissue and the characteristic symptoms of a heart attack. Therefore, if a patient is experiencing an exacerbation of myocardial ischemia, it is highly likely that they have or are at risk of developing an AMI."
Acidosis,435517,False,"No, acidosis is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Acidosis is a medical condition characterized by an imbalance in the body's pH levels, resulting in an excess of acid. While acidosis can occur in the setting of AMI due to inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation, it is not exclusive to this condition. Acidosis can also be caused by other medical conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, renal failure, sepsis, and respiratory failure. Therefore, the presence of acidosis does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Posterior ST segment elevation,45767558,False,"No

Rationale: Posterior ST segment elevation is a specific ECG finding that can be seen in patients with acute myocardial infarction, particularly in cases where the infarction involves the posterior wall of the heart. However, not all patients with acute myocardial infarction will present with posterior ST segment elevation. Therefore, while the presence of posterior ST segment elevation may suggest the possibility of acute myocardial infarction, it is not specific to the malady as there are other conditions that can also cause this ECG finding."
Acute coronary artery occlusion not resulting in myocardial infarction,44784623,False,"No

Rationale: Acute coronary artery occlusion not resulting in myocardial infarction is a condition where there is a sudden blockage of a coronary artery, but it does not lead to myocardial cell death and the release of cardiac biomarkers characteristic of a heart attack. In contrast, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) specifically involves the occlusion of a coronary artery leading to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, resulting in the release of cardiac biomarkers and characteristic symptoms. Therefore, if a person has acute coronary artery occlusion not resulting in myocardial infarction, they do not definitively have AMI."
Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia,437579,False,"No, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia is a type of arrhythmia characterized by a rapid heart rate originating from the ventricles of the heart. While it can occur in the setting of acute myocardial infarction as a complication, it can also be caused by other conditions such as electrolyte imbalances, structural heart disease, or certain medications. Therefore, the presence of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia does not definitively indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
Myocardial infarction in recovery phase,4170094,True,"Yes, the condition ""Myocardial infarction in recovery phase"" is specific to the malady ""Acute Myocardial Infarction."" 

Rationale:
The condition ""Myocardial infarction in recovery phase"" specifically refers to a patient who has recently experienced an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and is now in the recovery phase. This condition is a direct result of the malady ""Acute Myocardial Infarction,"" as it indicates that the patient has previously suffered from a heart attack. Therefore, if a patient has the condition ""Myocardial infarction in recovery phase,"" they definitely have the malady ""Acute Myocardial Infarction."""
Postoperative subendocardial myocardial infarction,4206867,True,"Yes, postoperative subendocardial myocardial infarction is specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 

Postoperative subendocardial myocardial infarction refers to a heart attack that occurs in the subendocardial layer of the heart muscle following a surgical procedure. This condition is a specific type of AMI that is triggered by the stress of surgery and can be a complication in the postoperative period. The underlying mechanism and presentation of postoperative subendocardial myocardial infarction align with the general description of AMI, including the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. Therefore, if a patient is diagnosed with postoperative subendocardial myocardial infarction, they definitely have the malady of acute myocardial infarction."
Dissection of coronary artery,37115756,False,"No

Rationale: Dissection of a coronary artery is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While it can be a potential complication of AMI, it can also occur in other conditions such as spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) or iatrogenic causes. Therefore, having a dissection of a coronary artery does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Anterior and lateral ST segment elevation,45772774,True,"Yes, anterior and lateral ST segment elevation is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). In the description of AMI provided, it is mentioned that diagnosis is confirmed by electrocardiography (ECG) findings indicative of ST-segment elevation. Anterior and lateral ST segment elevation on ECG is a classic finding in AMI, particularly in cases where the occlusion of the coronary artery affects the anterior or lateral walls of the heart. Therefore, if a patient presents with anterior and lateral ST segment elevation, it strongly suggests the presence of AMI."
Congestive heart failure,319835,False,"No

Rationale:
Congestive heart failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to congestive heart failure as a complication due to the damage to the heart muscle, congestive heart failure can have various causes such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having congestive heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has had an acute myocardial infarction."
EKG: myocardial infarction,4064609,True,"Yes, the condition ""EKG: myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

An EKG showing signs of myocardial infarction, such as ST-segment elevation or new-onset Q waves, is a key diagnostic criterion for AMI. These EKG changes indicate acute ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, which are characteristic features of a heart attack. Therefore, if a patient presents with an EKG showing signs of myocardial infarction, it is highly likely that they have AMI."
Primary cardiomyopathy,4232495,False,"No

Rationale: Primary cardiomyopathy is a broad term that encompasses various diseases of the heart muscle, including dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. While primary cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure and potentially increase the risk of acute myocardial infarction, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction is specifically defined by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which is not necessarily a characteristic of primary cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having primary cardiomyopathy does not definitively mean that an individual will have an acute myocardial infarction."
Postoperative transmural myocardial infarction of anterior wall,4207921,True,"Yes, the condition of postoperative transmural myocardial infarction of the anterior wall is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Transmural myocardial infarction refers to the involvement of the full thickness of the myocardial wall, which is a characteristic feature of AMI. The specific location of the infarction in the anterior wall indicates a particular area of the heart affected by the occlusion of a coronary artery, leading to ischemia and necrosis. 

Therefore, if a patient has postoperative transmural myocardial infarction of the anterior wall, they definitely have experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Inferior and right sided ST segment elevation,45767627,True,"Yes, the condition of inferior and right-sided ST segment elevation is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). In the context of AMI, ST segment elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key diagnostic criterion, particularly when it involves the inferior and right-sided leads. This pattern of ST segment elevation indicates myocardial ischemia or infarction in the corresponding areas of the heart supplied by the affected coronary arteries. Therefore, if a patient presents with inferior and right-sided ST segment elevation, it strongly suggests the presence of AMI."
Mechanical complication due to coronary bypass graft,432499,False,"No

Rationale: A mechanical complication due to coronary bypass graft is a specific condition that can occur as a result of a coronary artery bypass surgery, where there may be issues such as graft occlusion, stenosis, or aneurysm formation. While this condition may be a complication of a previous coronary artery bypass surgery, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which is not directly related to mechanical complications of a bypass graft. Therefore, having a mechanical complication due to coronary bypass graft does not definitively mean that a person has experienced an AMI."
Coronary microvascular disease,44806109,False,"No

Rationale:
Coronary microvascular disease is a condition that affects the small blood vessels of the heart, leading to impaired blood flow to the myocardium. While it can present with symptoms similar to those of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to AMI. Patients with coronary microvascular disease may experience chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms, but they do not necessarily have AMI. AMI specifically refers to the occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which is not a defining characteristic of coronary microvascular disease. Therefore, having coronary microvascular disease does not definitively mean that a person has had an AMI."
Coronary artery atheroma,4194618,True,"Yes, the condition of coronary artery atheroma is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Coronary artery atheroma refers to the buildup of plaque within the coronary arteries, which can lead to the occlusion of a coronary artery and subsequent ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, ultimately resulting in a heart attack. Therefore, if a person has coronary artery atheroma, they are at an increased risk of developing AMI."
Fear of having a heart attack,4085056,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""fear of having a heart attack"" is a psychological state of anxiety or worry about the possibility of experiencing a heart attack. While this fear may be common in individuals who have risk factors for cardiovascular disease or have a family history of heart attacks, it is not a specific symptom or diagnostic criterion for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI is diagnosed based on clinical presentation, ECG findings, and cardiac biomarkers, rather than subjective feelings of fear. Therefore, having a fear of having a heart attack does not definitively indicate the presence of an AMI."
Aortocoronary bypass graft present,42537729,False,"No

Rationale:
Having an aortocoronary bypass graft present does not definitively indicate the presence of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Aortocoronary bypass grafts are surgical procedures used to bypass blocked coronary arteries and restore blood flow to the heart muscle. While patients with a history of AMI may undergo aortocoronary bypass graft surgery as part of their treatment, the presence of a graft alone does not confirm the diagnosis of AMI. It is possible for individuals with aortocoronary bypass grafts to have other cardiac conditions or no current cardiac issues at all. Therefore, the condition of having an aortocoronary bypass graft present is not specific to the malady of acute myocardial infarction."
Coronary artery graft present,42537730,False,"No

Rationale:
The presence of a coronary artery graft does not definitively indicate the presence of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While a coronary artery graft may be used as a treatment option for patients with coronary artery disease to bypass blocked or narrowed arteries, it does not necessarily mean that the patient has experienced a heart attack. Patients with a history of coronary artery grafts may be at an increased risk for AMI due to underlying cardiovascular disease, but the presence of a graft alone does not confirm the diagnosis of AMI. Additional clinical evaluation and diagnostic criteria, as outlined in the description of the malady, are required to diagnose AMI."
Hemopericardium,258449,True,"Yes, Hemopericardium is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction.

Rationale:
Hemopericardium refers to the accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. In the context of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), hemopericardium can occur as a complication of the heart attack. When a coronary artery is occluded during AMI, it can lead to myocardial rupture and subsequent bleeding into the pericardial sac, causing hemopericardium. Therefore, if a patient has hemopericardium, it is highly likely that they have experienced an AMI. However, not all cases of AMI will result in hemopericardium, as it is a potential complication rather than a universal feature of AMI."
Toxic nephropathy,4126119,False,"No

Rationale:
Toxic nephropathy refers to kidney damage caused by exposure to toxic substances such as medications, chemicals, or heavy metals. While toxic nephropathy can lead to various complications, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. The two conditions involve different organ systems and pathophysiological processes. Therefore, having toxic nephropathy does not definitively indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
First myocardial infarction,4215259,True,"Yes, the condition ""First myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady Acute Myocardial Infarction. If a person has experienced their first myocardial infarction, they definitely have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. This is because a myocardial infarction, or heart attack, is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, which aligns with the condition of a first myocardial infarction. Therefore, the presence of the condition indicates the presence of the malady."
Acute respiratory distress,4191650,False,"No

Rationale: Acute respiratory distress is a non-specific condition that can be caused by a variety of underlying medical issues such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While acute respiratory distress can be a symptom of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to the heart's inability to pump effectively, it is not specific to AMI and can be present in other medical conditions as well. Therefore, having acute respiratory distress does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Respiratory failure,4256228,False,"No, respiratory failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Respiratory failure is a condition where the respiratory system fails to adequately oxygenate the blood and/or remove carbon dioxide, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. While respiratory failure can occur as a complication of acute myocardial infarction due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or other factors, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Acute myocardial infarction is primarily characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis, with symptoms such as chest pain, ECG changes, and elevated cardiac biomarkers."
Dependence on respirator,46273390,False,"No, dependence on a respirator is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While a patient with AMI may require respiratory support due to complications such as heart failure or respiratory distress, dependence on a respirator can be caused by a variety of other medical conditions such as respiratory failure, neuromuscular disorders, or traumatic injuries. Therefore, having dependence on a respirator does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Congenital coronary artery sclerosis,4178321,False,"No.

Rationale:
Congenital coronary artery sclerosis refers to the narrowing or hardening of the coronary arteries present at birth. This condition is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as it does not necessarily lead to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery that characterizes a heart attack. While congenital coronary artery sclerosis may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, including AMI, it does not definitively indicate the presence of an acute myocardial infarction. Other factors such as plaque rupture or thrombus formation are typically responsible for the acute occlusion seen in AMI. Therefore, having congenital coronary artery sclerosis does not guarantee the presence of an acute myocardial infarction."
Old lateral myocardial infarction,4119950,True,"Yes, the condition of old lateral myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale:
An old lateral myocardial infarction refers to a previous heart attack that affected the lateral wall of the heart. Since acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, an old lateral myocardial infarction would be a past event of AMI affecting the lateral region of the heart. Therefore, if a person has an old lateral myocardial infarction, it indicates that they have previously experienced a heart attack, which aligns with the definition of AMI. On the other hand, not all cases of AMI may result in a specific location such as the lateral wall, so having an old lateral myocardial infarction does not necessarily mean that a person currently has AMI, but it does indicate a history of the condition."
Accelerated coronary artery disease in transplanted heart,4119951,True,"Yes, the condition of accelerated coronary artery disease in a transplanted heart is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Accelerated coronary artery disease in a transplanted heart refers to the rapid development of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries of a transplanted heart, leading to potential ischemic events such as AMI. This condition is directly related to the malady of AMI, as the occlusion of a coronary artery in the transplanted heart can result in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, similar to the pathophysiology of a heart attack. Therefore, if an individual has accelerated coronary artery disease in a transplanted heart, they are at a high risk of experiencing an AMI."
Old anterior myocardial infarction,4119949,True,"Yes, the condition of old anterior myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale:
An old anterior myocardial infarction refers to a previous heart attack that affected the anterior (front) part of the heart. Since acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, an old anterior myocardial infarction would be a past event of AMI. Therefore, if a person has an old anterior myocardial infarction, they definitely had a previous episode of AMI. However, not all cases of AMI will result in an old anterior myocardial infarction, as the location of the infarction can vary."
Stable angina,4119942,False,"No, stable angina is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Stable angina is a condition characterized by chest pain or discomfort that occurs with exertion or emotional stress and is relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. It is caused by temporary ischemia of the heart muscle due to narrowed coronary arteries, but it does not necessarily lead to myocardial cell death like in AMI. While stable angina can be a precursor to AMI, not all individuals with stable angina will go on to have a heart attack. Therefore, having stable angina does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Hypovolemic shock,4192647,False,"No

Rationale:
Hypovolemic shock is a condition characterized by a significant decrease in blood volume, leading to inadequate perfusion of tissues and organs. While hypovolemic shock can result from various causes such as hemorrhage, dehydration, or severe burns, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Although AMI can potentially lead to cardiogenic shock, which is a form of distributive shock, it is not synonymous with hypovolemic shock. Therefore, the presence of hypovolemic shock does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Angina decubitus,315832,False,"No

Rationale:
Angina decubitus refers to chest pain that occurs specifically when lying down and is relieved upon sitting or standing. This condition is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as it can also be seen in other cardiac conditions such as stable angina or pericarditis. While AMI can present with chest pain, it is typically described as severe and persistent, often radiating to the left arm, jaw, or back, and is not necessarily positional like angina decubitus. Therefore, the presence of angina decubitus does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Double coronary vessel disease,4108673,False,"No

Rationale: While double coronary vessel disease may increase the risk of developing acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to AMI. Double coronary vessel disease refers to the presence of significant blockages in two coronary arteries, which can lead to ischemia and potentially AMI. However, not all individuals with double coronary vessel disease will necessarily experience an AMI. Other factors such as plaque stability, collateral circulation, and timely intervention play a role in determining whether an individual with double coronary vessel disease will develop an AMI. Therefore, having double coronary vessel disease does not definitively mean that an individual will have an AMI."
Coronary atherosclerosis of biologic bypass,3180023,False,"No.

Rationale:
Coronary atherosclerosis of biologic bypass is a specific condition related to the presence of a bypass graft in the coronary arteries to treat coronary artery disease. While coronary atherosclerosis is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction, the presence of a bypass graft does not definitively indicate the occurrence of an acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, having coronary atherosclerosis of biologic bypass does not necessarily mean that an individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Occlusion of artery,4162038,True,"Yes, the condition ""Occlusion of artery"" is specific to the malady ""Acute Myocardial Infarction."" In the description of Acute Myocardial Infarction, it is mentioned that it is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. Therefore, if a person has the condition of occlusion of an artery, it is highly likely that they have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Posterior myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram,4253065,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Posterior myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram"" is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

In the description of AMI provided, it is mentioned that diagnosis is confirmed by electrocardiography (ECG) findings indicative of ST-segment elevation or new-onset Q waves. A posterior myocardial infarction on an ECG would be consistent with the diagnosis of AMI, as it indicates ischemia or necrosis of the posterior wall of the heart. Therefore, if a patient has a posterior myocardial infarction on an ECG, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Right ventricular abnormality,4101621,False,"No, a right ventricular abnormality is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While AMI can lead to right ventricular involvement due to the close proximity of the right coronary artery to the right ventricle, a right ventricular abnormality can be caused by various other conditions such as pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, congenital heart defects, or arrhythmias. Therefore, having a right ventricular abnormality does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Alkalosis,438730,False,"No, alkalosis is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Alkalosis is a condition characterized by an abnormal increase in the pH of the blood and body tissues, which can be caused by various factors such as hyperventilation, vomiting, or certain medications. While alkalosis can occur in some patients with acute myocardial infarction due to respiratory compensation mechanisms, it is not a specific indicator of this condition. Therefore, having alkalosis does not definitively mean that a person has acute myocardial infarction."
Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary artery,618951,True,"Yes, the condition of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary artery (MINOCA) is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). MINOCA refers to cases where patients present with symptoms and signs of a heart attack, such as elevated cardiac biomarkers and ECG changes indicative of myocardial injury, but do not have significant coronary artery blockages on angiography. 

While MINOCA is a distinct entity from typical AMI, it is still considered a type of myocardial infarction and falls under the broader category of acute coronary syndromes. Patients with MINOCA may have different underlying mechanisms for their myocardial injury, such as coronary artery spasm, microvascular dysfunction, or plaque disruption without significant stenosis. However, the presence of MINOCA still indicates myocardial damage and the need for appropriate management and follow-up similar to traditional AMI cases."
Acute pulmonary edema,261600,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute pulmonary edema is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While acute pulmonary edema can be a complication of AMI due to heart failure resulting from myocardial damage, it can also be caused by other conditions such as heart failure, pneumonia, or kidney failure. Therefore, if a person has acute pulmonary edema, they may or may not have AMI."
Occlusion of intermediate artery,3655134,False,"No, the condition ""Occlusion of intermediate artery"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial infarction, the occlusion of an intermediate artery does not necessarily indicate AMI. The occlusion of an intermediate artery could potentially lead to other conditions such as ischemia in a different organ or tissue, depending on the location of the artery. Therefore, the presence of occlusion of an intermediate artery does not definitively mean the individual has AMI."
Rupture of interventricular septum,4149712,False,"No, the condition ""Rupture of interventricular septum"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While a rupture of the interventricular septum can be a complication of AMI due to the necrosis and weakening of the myocardium, it can also occur in other conditions such as trauma, infective endocarditis, or congenital heart defects. Therefore, the presence of a rupture of the interventricular septum does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
TIMI grade 0: no perfusion,4161991,True,"Yes, the condition of TIMI grade 0 (no perfusion) is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) grade 0 indicates complete absence of antegrade flow in the culprit coronary artery, which is a hallmark of AMI. In the context of AMI, TIMI grade 0 signifies severe coronary artery occlusion leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis, consistent with the pathophysiology of a heart attack. Therefore, if a patient presents with TIMI grade 0, it strongly suggests the presence of AMI."
TIMI grade 1: penetration without perfusion,4161990,False,"No, the condition of TIMI grade 1: penetration without perfusion is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) grade 1 refers to minimal to no perfusion of the myocardium despite the presence of a patent coronary artery after a heart attack. While this finding can be seen in patients with AMI, it is not exclusive to this condition. Other conditions such as coronary artery disease, myocarditis, or even vasospasm can also present with TIMI grade 1 flow. Therefore, having TIMI grade 1 does not definitively mean that a patient has AMI, as it can be seen in a variety of cardiac conditions."
TIMI grade 2: partial perfusion,4161989,False,"No, the condition of TIMI grade 2: partial perfusion is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) grade 2 refers to partial perfusion of the myocardium following a heart attack. While this can be seen in cases of AMI, it is not exclusive to this condition. TIMI grade 2 can also be observed in other cardiac conditions such as unstable angina or even in non-cardiac conditions that affect myocardial perfusion. Therefore, having TIMI grade 2 does not definitively mean that a person has AMI, as it can be present in a variety of clinical scenarios."
Pulmonary congestion and hypostasis,438791,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary congestion and hypostasis are not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While they can be seen in some cases of AMI due to heart failure as a complication, they are not exclusive to AMI and can be present in other conditions such as congestive heart failure, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the presence of pulmonary congestion and hypostasis alone does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Myocardial ischemia manifest on stress test status post myocardial infarction,4155965,True,"Yes, the condition ""Myocardial ischemia manifest on stress test status post myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).

Rationale:
The condition specifically mentions myocardial infarction, which is synonymous with AMI. Additionally, the presence of myocardial ischemia on a stress test post myocardial infarction indicates ongoing ischemic events in the heart, which is a characteristic feature of AMI. Therefore, if a patient has this condition, they definitely have experienced an AMI."
Left main coronary artery disease,4155962,True,"Yes, left main coronary artery disease is specific to acute myocardial infarction. The left main coronary artery supplies a significant portion of the heart muscle, and if it becomes occluded, it can lead to a large area of myocardial ischemia and subsequent infarction. Therefore, if a patient has left main coronary artery disease, they are at high risk for developing an acute myocardial infarction."
Coronary atherosclerosis,40481919,True,"Yes, coronary atherosclerosis is specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Coronary atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can lead to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery and result in an AMI. If a person has coronary atherosclerosis, they are at an increased risk of experiencing an AMI. However, not everyone with coronary atherosclerosis will necessarily have an AMI, as other factors such as plaque stability and rupture play a role in the development of an AMI."
Left heart failure,439846,False,"No

Rationale:
Left heart failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While AMI can lead to left heart failure as a complication due to the damage to the myocardium, left heart failure can also be caused by other conditions such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having left heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has had an AMI."
Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure,44782733,False,"No, the condition ""Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While heart failure can be a complication of AMI, it is not exclusive to this condition. Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure refers to a specific type of heart failure where the heart is unable to pump effectively (systolic dysfunction) and relax properly (diastolic dysfunction). This can be caused by various factors such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, or other underlying conditions. Therefore, the presence of this condition does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Myocardial disease,4239975,False,"No

Rationale:
While myocardial disease is a broad term that encompasses various conditions affecting the heart muscle, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI is a specific type of myocardial disease characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. Therefore, having a myocardial disease does not necessarily mean that an individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Coronary arteriosclerosis in artery of transplanted heart,37312532,False,"No

Rationale: While coronary arteriosclerosis can lead to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the general population, the presence of this condition in the artery of a transplanted heart may not necessarily result in AMI. In the context of a transplanted heart, the immune response and other factors may play a role in the development of coronary arteriosclerosis and subsequent AMI. Therefore, the presence of coronary arteriosclerosis in the artery of a transplanted heart does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Mitral valve regurgitation,443962,False,"No

Rationale: Mitral valve regurgitation is a condition where the mitral valve does not close properly, causing blood to flow backward into the left atrium of the heart. While mitral valve regurgitation can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While a heart attack can lead to mitral valve regurgitation as a complication, having mitral valve regurgitation does not definitively mean that a person has had a heart attack. Therefore, the presence of mitral valve regurgitation does not necessarily indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
Multi vessel coronary artery disease,4155007,False,"No

Rationale:
While multi-vessel coronary artery disease can increase the risk of developing an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to AMI. Multi-vessel coronary artery disease refers to the presence of significant blockages in multiple coronary arteries, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle and increase the risk of various cardiac events, including AMI. However, not all individuals with multi-vessel coronary artery disease will necessarily experience an AMI. Therefore, having multi-vessel coronary artery disease does not definitively mean that an individual has had or will have an AMI."
Acute respiratory failure,319049,False,"No

Rationale: Acute respiratory failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Acute respiratory failure is a condition where the respiratory system fails to adequately oxygenate the blood or remove carbon dioxide, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. While acute respiratory failure can occur as a complication of acute myocardial infarction due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or respiratory distress, it is not a defining characteristic of the malady itself. Therefore, having acute respiratory failure does not definitively mean that a person has acute myocardial infarction."
Low blood pressure,317002,False,"No, low blood pressure is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While low blood pressure can be a symptom of AMI due to decreased cardiac output, it is not exclusive to this condition. Low blood pressure can be caused by a variety of factors such as dehydration, medications, or other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, having low blood pressure does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Generalized ischemic myocardial dysfunction,4110961,False,"No, generalized ischemic myocardial dysfunction is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While AMI involves ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue due to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, generalized ischemic myocardial dysfunction can be caused by various other conditions such as severe heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or systemic hypoperfusion. Therefore, having generalized ischemic myocardial dysfunction does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Congenital anomaly of coronary artery,321109,False,"No

Rationale:
A congenital anomaly of the coronary artery is a structural abnormality present at birth involving the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. While this condition may impact blood flow to the heart, it does not necessarily lead to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery characteristic of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Therefore, having a congenital anomaly of the coronary artery does not definitively mean that an individual will have an AMI."
Disorder of cardiac ventricle,4166245,False,"No, a disorder of the cardiac ventricle is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While AMI can lead to damage of the cardiac ventricle due to the ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, a disorder of the cardiac ventricle can be caused by various other conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or valvular heart disease. Therefore, having a disorder of the cardiac ventricle does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Asymptomatic coronary heart disease,4199962,False,"No, asymptomatic coronary heart disease is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Asymptomatic coronary heart disease refers to the presence of coronary artery disease without any symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. While asymptomatic coronary heart disease can increase the risk of developing acute myocardial infarction, not all individuals with asymptomatic coronary heart disease will go on to have a heart attack. Therefore, having asymptomatic coronary heart disease does not definitively mean that an individual will have an acute myocardial infarction."
Left ventricular abnormality,442982,False,"No

Rationale: A left ventricular abnormality is a broad term that can encompass a variety of conditions affecting the left ventricle of the heart, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular dilation, or left ventricular dysfunction. While an acute myocardial infarction can lead to left ventricular abnormalities as a consequence of the damage to the heart muscle, not all left ventricular abnormalities are specific to acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, having a left ventricular abnormality does not definitively mean that a person has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure,46273719,False,"No

Rationale: Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by an elevated level of carbon dioxide in the blood, often due to inadequate ventilation. It can be caused by various conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neuromuscular disorders, or central nervous system depression. While acute hypercapnic respiratory failure can occur in patients with acute myocardial infarction, it is not a defining feature of the condition. Therefore, having acute hypercapnic respiratory failure does not definitively mean that a person has acute myocardial infarction."
Late effect of medical and surgical care complication,434814,False,"No, the condition ""Late effect of medical and surgical care complication"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). This condition refers to complications that arise as a result of medical or surgical interventions, which can occur in a variety of medical conditions and procedures, not just AMI. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Bifascicular block,4250169,False,"No

Rationale:
Bifascicular block is a conduction abnormality in the heart characterized by the blockage of two of the three main fascicles of the bundle branches. While bifascicular block can be a risk factor for developing more serious conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Bifascicular block can be present in patients with AMI, but it can also be present in individuals without AMI. Therefore, having bifascicular block does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
New myocardial infarction compared to prior study,4179525,True,"Yes, the condition ""New myocardial infarction compared to prior study"" is specific to the malady Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

The condition specifically mentions a new myocardial infarction, which aligns with the description of AMI as a sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death. The comparison to a prior study suggests that the individual has had a previous myocardial infarction, making it more likely that the current event is indeed AMI. Additionally, the diagnosis of AMI involves clinical history, ECG findings, and elevated cardiac biomarkers, which would be necessary to confirm the presence of a new myocardial infarction compared to a prior study. Therefore, if someone has the condition ""New myocardial infarction compared to prior study,"" they definitely have the malady Acute Myocardial Infarction."
At risk of coronary heart disease,4201021,False,"No, being at risk of coronary heart disease is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While individuals who are at risk of coronary heart disease may have an increased likelihood of experiencing a heart attack, not all individuals at risk will necessarily develop AMI. AMI is a specific event characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which may or may not occur in individuals at risk of coronary heart disease. Therefore, the presence of the condition ""at risk of coronary heart disease"" does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Ventricular fibrillation,437894,True,"Yes, ventricular fibrillation is specific to acute myocardial infarction. Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can occur as a complication of acute myocardial infarction. When a coronary artery is occluded during a heart attack, it can lead to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, which can disrupt the normal electrical conduction of the heart and result in ventricular fibrillation. Therefore, if a patient presents with ventricular fibrillation, it is highly suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction as the underlying cause."
Recurrent coronary arteriosclerosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty,4178622,False,"No

Rationale:
While recurrent coronary arteriosclerosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can be a risk factor for developing acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to the malady. There are various other factors that can lead to AMI, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and family history of heart disease. Therefore, having recurrent coronary arteriosclerosis after angioplasty does not definitively mean that a person has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia,37309626,False,"No, the condition ""Myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia"" is not specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Demand ischemia refers to a situation where the heart muscle does not receive enough blood supply due to increased demand, such as during physical exertion. While demand ischemia can lead to a myocardial infarction (heart attack), it is not specific to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery that characterizes AMI. 

AMI, on the other hand, is specifically defined by the abrupt interruption of blood flow to a portion of the myocardium, resulting in myocardial cell death. Therefore, having demand ischemia does not definitively mean that one has AMI, as there are other potential causes of demand ischemia besides AMI."
EKG ST segment changes,4184762,True,"Yes, EKG ST segment changes are specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). In the context of AMI, EKG findings indicative of ST-segment elevation or new-onset Q waves are key diagnostic criteria. These changes reflect myocardial ischemia and injury, which are characteristic of a heart attack. Therefore, if a patient presents with EKG ST segment changes, it strongly suggests the presence of AMI."
Resting ischemia,37016755,False,"No

Rationale: Resting ischemia refers to a condition where there is inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle during periods of rest, leading to ischemia but not necessarily necrosis of cardiac tissue. While resting ischemia can be a precursor to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to AMI as it can also occur in other conditions such as stable angina. Therefore, having resting ischemia does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Coronary artery disease due to type 2 diabetes mellitus,37309630,True,"Yes, the condition of coronary artery disease due to type 2 diabetes mellitus is specific to the malady of acute myocardial infarction. 

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease due to the metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes, such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and inflammation. Coronary artery disease is a major risk factor for acute myocardial infarction, as it can lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries, which may rupture and cause an acute occlusion leading to a heart attack. Therefore, if a patient has coronary artery disease due to type 2 diabetes mellitus, they are at a higher risk of experiencing an acute myocardial infarction."
Acute tubular necrosis,444044,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a condition characterized by damage to the renal tubules in the kidneys, often caused by ischemia or nephrotoxic agents. While ATN can occur in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to decreased renal perfusion secondary to cardiac dysfunction, it is not specific to AMI. ATN can also be caused by other conditions such as sepsis, hypovolemia, and exposure to nephrotoxic medications. Therefore, the presence of ATN does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Septic shock,196236,False,"No

Rationale:
Septic shock is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Septic shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs as a result of an overwhelming infection leading to systemic inflammation, hypotension, and organ dysfunction. While a patient with acute myocardial infarction may develop septic shock as a complication, septic shock can also occur in the absence of a heart attack. Therefore, having septic shock does not definitively mean that a person has acute myocardial infarction."
Tachycardia,444070,False,"No, tachycardia is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Tachycardia is a condition characterized by a rapid heart rate, typically defined as a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute. While tachycardia can be a symptom of AMI, it is not specific to this condition and can be present in a variety of other medical conditions such as dehydration, fever, anxiety, hyperthyroidism, or even as a side effect of certain medications. Therefore, having tachycardia does not definitively mean that an individual has AMI, as it can be caused by a range of other factors."
Coronary artery bypass graft occlusion,4252385,False,"No

Rationale: While coronary artery bypass graft occlusion can lead to ischemia and potentially contribute to the development of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to AMI. Coronary artery bypass graft occlusion can occur in the absence of AMI and may present with symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or signs of myocardial ischemia. Therefore, having coronary artery bypass graft occlusion does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Anterior myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram,4180609,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Anterior myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram"" is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). An anterior myocardial infarction on an electrocardiogram (ECG) indicates that there is ischemia or necrosis in the anterior wall of the heart, which is a common location for AMI to occur. The ECG findings of ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads would be consistent with a diagnosis of AMI. Therefore, if a patient has an anterior myocardial infarction on ECG, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Hypertensive heart failure,444101,False,"No

Rationale:
Hypertensive heart failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While hypertension is a risk factor for developing heart disease, including myocardial infarction, hypertensive heart failure can also result from chronic uncontrolled high blood pressure leading to left ventricular hypertrophy and eventual heart failure. Therefore, a person with hypertensive heart failure may or may not have had a previous acute myocardial infarction."
Mural thrombus of right ventricle,42534988,False,"No, the condition ""Mural thrombus of right ventricle"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While a mural thrombus in the right ventricle can be a complication of AMI, it can also occur in other conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, or pulmonary embolism. Therefore, having a mural thrombus of the right ventricle does not definitively mean that the individual has had an AMI. Additional diagnostic tests and clinical evaluation would be needed to determine the underlying cause of the thrombus."
Disorder of cardiovascular prostheses and implants,142026,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of cardiovascular prostheses and implants"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While individuals with AMI may have cardiovascular prostheses or implants as part of their treatment or management, the presence of a disorder related to these devices does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI. AMI is specifically characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which is not directly related to issues with cardiovascular prostheses or implants. Therefore, the condition is not specific to the malady."
Acute renal failure syndrome,197320,False,"No, acute renal failure syndrome is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Acute renal failure syndrome refers to a sudden decline in kidney function, which can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, medication toxicity, infection, or obstruction of the urinary tract. While acute renal failure can occur as a complication of acute myocardial infarction due to decreased cardiac output and subsequent reduced renal perfusion, it is not a defining characteristic of AMI. Therefore, having acute renal failure syndrome does not definitively indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
Acute myocardial ischemia,4189939,True,"Yes, acute myocardial ischemia is specific to acute myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial ischemia refers to the inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle, which can lead to myocardial infarction if not promptly treated. In the context of the malady described (acute myocardial infarction), acute myocardial ischemia is a key component of the pathophysiology, as it ultimately results in myocardial cell death and necrosis. Therefore, if a person has acute myocardial ischemia, they are at risk of developing acute myocardial infarction."
Acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure,44782718,False,"No

Rationale: Acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure is a condition characterized by both impaired contraction (systolic dysfunction) and impaired relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) of the heart muscle, leading to inadequate pumping of blood and fluid accumulation in the body. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to heart failure as a complication, not all cases of acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure are specifically caused by acute myocardial infarction. There are various other causes of heart failure, such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that the individual has had an acute myocardial infarction."
Heart failure,316139,False,"No

Rationale: Heart failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While AMI can lead to heart failure as a complication due to the damage to the heart muscle caused by the lack of blood flow during the heart attack, heart failure can have various other causes such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has had an acute myocardial infarction."
Non-Q wave myocardial infarction,4200113,True,"Yes, the condition of non-Q wave myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Non-Q wave myocardial infarction refers to a type of AMI where there is myocardial damage without the presence of Q waves on the ECG. This condition is a subset of AMI and is characterized by elevated cardiac biomarkers and symptoms consistent with AMI, such as chest pain and shortness of breath. Therefore, if a patient has non-Q wave myocardial infarction, they definitely have the malady of AMI."
Chronic passive congestion of liver,200451,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic passive congestion of the liver is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Chronic passive congestion of the liver is a condition characterized by impaired blood flow within the liver, leading to hepatic congestion and potential liver dysfunction. It is typically associated with conditions such as congestive heart failure, hepatic vein obstruction, or portal vein obstruction. While chronic passive congestion of the liver may be seen in patients with heart failure, it is not a defining feature of acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, the presence of chronic passive congestion of the liver does not definitively indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
Mural thrombus of left ventricle,36712752,True,"Yes, a mural thrombus of the left ventricle is specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 

A mural thrombus of the left ventricle is a complication that can occur following an AMI due to the formation of a blood clot within the damaged area of the heart muscle. This thrombus can lead to further complications such as embolization and stroke. Therefore, if a patient has a mural thrombus of the left ventricle, it is highly likely that they have experienced an AMI. However, not all patients with AMI will develop a mural thrombus, so the presence of this condition does not necessarily confirm the diagnosis of AMI."
Arteriosclerosis of arterial coronary artery bypass graft,40483189,False,"No, arteriosclerosis of arterial coronary artery bypass graft is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While arteriosclerosis can contribute to the development of coronary artery disease and potentially lead to a heart attack, it is not a definitive indicator of an acute myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction is specifically characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, which may or may not be directly related to arteriosclerosis of a bypass graft."
Angina pectoris,321318,False,"No

Rationale: Angina pectoris is a condition characterized by chest pain or discomfort due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. While angina pectoris can be a symptom of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), not all cases of angina pectoris will progress to a heart attack. Therefore, having angina pectoris does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Cardiomyopathy,321319,False,"No

Rationale:
Cardiomyopathy is a broad term that refers to diseases of the heart muscle, where the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thickened, or rigid. While cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure and other complications, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI is a specific event characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, which is not necessarily always present in cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having cardiomyopathy does not definitively mean that an individual has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Ischemic contracture of left ventricle syndrome,4219755,False,"No, ischemic contracture of left ventricle syndrome is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Ischemic contracture of the left ventricle is a rare complication of acute myocardial infarction, where the affected area of the heart becomes permanently contracted due to severe ischemia. While it is often associated with AMI, it can also occur in other conditions that cause severe ischemia to the heart muscle. Therefore, having ischemic contracture of the left ventricle syndrome does not definitively mean that the individual has had an acute myocardial infarction."
Rupture of papillary muscle,432937,False,"No

Rupture of papillary muscle is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While it can be a complication of AMI, it can also occur in other conditions such as infective endocarditis, trauma, or chronic ischemic heart disease. Therefore, if a patient has a rupture of papillary muscle, they may or may not have AMI."
Old posterior myocardial infarction,4121468,True,"Yes, the condition of old posterior myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

An old posterior myocardial infarction refers to a previous heart attack that affected the posterior wall of the heart. Since AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, an old posterior myocardial infarction would be a manifestation of this malady. Therefore, if a person has an old posterior myocardial infarction, they definitely have experienced an acute myocardial infarction in the past."
Old inferior myocardial infarction,4121467,True,"Yes, the condition of ""old inferior myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale: An old inferior myocardial infarction refers to a previous heart attack that affected the inferior part of the heart. Since acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death, an old inferior myocardial infarction would be a past event of AMI affecting the inferior part of the heart. Therefore, if a person has an old inferior myocardial infarction, they have definitely experienced a heart attack in the past, which aligns with the definition of AMI."
Mural thrombus of heart,4237062,False,"No

Rationale: A mural thrombus of the heart is a blood clot that forms on the walls of the heart chambers, typically in the setting of conditions such as myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, or atrial fibrillation. While a mural thrombus can be a complication of acute myocardial infarction, it is not specific to this malady. Therefore, having a mural thrombus of the heart does not definitively mean that a person has experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Structural disorder of heart,4027255,False,"No, a structural disorder of the heart is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While AMI can result in structural damage to the heart due to the necrosis of cardiac tissue, there are many other conditions that can also cause structural disorders of the heart, such as congenital heart defects, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and arrhythmias. Therefore, having a structural disorder of the heart does not definitively mean that a person has had an acute myocardial infarction."
Hypervolemia,434004,False,"No, hypervolemia is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).

Hypervolemia refers to an excessive volume of fluid in the blood vessels, which can be caused by various conditions such as heart failure, kidney disease, liver disease, or excessive fluid intake. While hypervolemia can be a risk factor for AMI due to increased workload on the heart and potential for fluid overload, it is not a specific indicator or symptom of AMI. AMI is primarily characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis, with symptoms such as severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and ECG changes. Therefore, having hypervolemia does not definitively mean that a person has AMI, as there are other potential causes for hypervolemia unrelated to AMI."
Unstable angina co-occurrent and due to arteriosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft,35615053,True,"Yes, the condition of unstable angina co-occurrent and due to arteriosclerosis of coronary artery bypass graft is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Unstable angina is a condition characterized by chest pain or discomfort that occurs at rest or with minimal exertion and is due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. When unstable angina is specifically due to arteriosclerosis of a coronary artery bypass graft, it indicates a significant blockage in the graft vessel, which can lead to a sudden occlusion and subsequent myocardial infarction. Therefore, if a patient has unstable angina co-occurrent and due to arteriosclerosis of a coronary artery bypass graft, they are at high risk for developing an AMI."
Disease affecting entire cardiovascular system,4025194,False,"No, the condition ""Disease affecting entire cardiovascular system"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). While AMI is a specific type of cardiovascular disease that affects the heart due to a sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, a disease affecting the entire cardiovascular system could encompass a wide range of conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, and more. Therefore, having a disease affecting the entire cardiovascular system does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Silent coronary vasospastic disease,45766117,False,"No

Rationale: Silent coronary vasospastic disease refers to a condition where there are episodes of coronary artery spasm leading to transient myocardial ischemia without any symptoms. This condition is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as it does not necessarily result in the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial cell death and release of cardiac biomarkers. While silent coronary vasospastic disease may increase the risk of AMI, it does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Subendocardial ischemia,4263712,True,"Yes, subendocardial ischemia is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).

Rationale:
Subendocardial ischemia refers to inadequate blood supply to the innermost layer of the heart muscle, which can lead to myocardial damage if left untreated. In the context of AMI, the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery results in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, which can manifest as subendocardial ischemia. Therefore, if a patient has subendocardial ischemia, it is highly likely that they have AMI, as it is a common manifestation of this condition."
Cardiovascular injury,4152156,False,"No, cardiovascular injury is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Cardiovascular injury can be caused by a variety of factors such as trauma, infection, inflammation, or other cardiac conditions. While AMI can result in cardiovascular injury due to the necrosis of cardiac tissue, not all cases of cardiovascular injury are necessarily due to AMI. Therefore, having cardiovascular injury does not definitively mean that a person has AMI."
Pericarditis,4138837,False,"No

Rationale: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. While pericarditis can sometimes be a complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to AMI. Pericarditis can have various causes such as viral infections, autoimmune diseases, or trauma. Therefore, having pericarditis does not definitively mean that a person has had an AMI."
"Past myocardial infarction diagnosed on ECG AND/OR other special investigation, but currently presenting no symptoms",4138833,True,"Yes, the condition of a past myocardial infarction diagnosed on ECG and/or other special investigation, but currently presenting no symptoms is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale:
A past myocardial infarction diagnosed on ECG and/or other special investigation indicates a history of a heart attack, which is a key component of the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. Even if the individual is currently asymptomatic, the presence of a previous heart attack is a significant risk factor for future cardiovascular events and complications related to Acute Myocardial Infarction. Therefore, if someone has a documented history of a past myocardial infarction, they definitely have the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction."
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure,40481043,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure is a condition characterized by the exacerbation of chronic heart failure symptoms due to acute decompensation, leading to impaired relaxation of the heart muscle during diastole. While acute on chronic diastolic heart failure can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction is a distinct condition caused by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, resulting in myocardial ischemia and necrosis. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to heart failure as a complication, the presence of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure does not definitively indicate the presence of acute myocardial infarction."
Chronic total occlusion of coronary artery,36712779,False,"No, chronic total occlusion of a coronary artery is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While chronic total occlusion of a coronary artery can increase the risk of AMI by reducing blood flow to the heart muscle, it does not necessarily mean that a person with this condition will definitely have an AMI. Chronic total occlusion of a coronary artery can also lead to stable angina or other cardiac complications. Therefore, it is not a specific indicator of AMI."
Acute diastolic heart failure,40481042,False,"No

Rationale:
Acute diastolic heart failure is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Acute diastolic heart failure refers to a condition where the heart is unable to relax and fill properly during the diastolic phase, leading to impaired filling of the ventricles and subsequent symptoms of heart failure. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to heart failure, it is not the only cause of acute diastolic heart failure. Other causes include hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having acute diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has acute myocardial infarction."
Coronary artery thrombosis,4134723,True,"Yes, coronary artery thrombosis is specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Coronary artery thrombosis is the primary cause of AMI, as it leads to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. Therefore, if a patient has coronary artery thrombosis, they definitely have AMI."
Microinfarct of heart,4173632,False,"No

Rationale: A microinfarct of the heart refers to a small area of myocardial cell death due to ischemia, which is not typically associated with the clinical presentation of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While AMI involves the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to significant myocardial damage and characteristic symptoms such as severe chest pain, a microinfarct may be asymptomatic or present with milder symptoms. Therefore, the presence of a microinfarct of the heart does not definitively indicate the presence of an AMI."
Disorder of coronary artery,4187067,True,"Yes, a disorder of the coronary artery is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). AMI is characterized by the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery, leading to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. A disorder of the coronary artery would directly impact blood flow to the myocardium, which is a key factor in the development of AMI. Therefore, if someone has a disorder of the coronary artery, they are at risk for developing AMI."
Atrial fibrillation,313217,False,"No

Rationale:
Atrial fibrillation is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While atrial fibrillation can be a risk factor for AMI and may coexist with it, having atrial fibrillation does not definitively mean that a person has had a heart attack. Atrial fibrillation is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by irregular and rapid heartbeats originating in the atria, which can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure. It is important to evaluate each condition separately and consider other factors when diagnosing and managing patients with these conditions."
Subsequent myocardial infarction,4108217,True,"Yes, subsequent myocardial infarction is specific to acute myocardial infarction. 

Rationale: Subsequent myocardial infarction refers to a second heart attack occurring after the initial event. Since acute myocardial infarction is the initial event that leads to subsequent myocardial infarction, if a person has subsequent myocardial infarction, they definitely had acute myocardial infarction in the past. Therefore, the condition is specific to the malady."
Anxiety about having a heart attack,4080567,False,"No, anxiety about having a heart attack is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. While anxiety about having a heart attack may be a common symptom in individuals experiencing chest pain or other cardiac-related symptoms, it is not a definitive indicator of an actual heart attack. Anxiety can be a common response to various medical conditions or even non-medical stressors. Therefore, having anxiety about having a heart attack does not necessarily mean that an individual is experiencing an acute myocardial infarction. It is important to consider other clinical factors and diagnostic criteria to confirm the presence of a heart attack."
Coronary thrombosis not resulting in myocardial infarction,4108215,False,"No, the condition of coronary thrombosis not resulting in myocardial infarction is not specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Coronary thrombosis refers to the formation of a blood clot within a coronary artery, which can lead to a blockage of blood flow to the heart muscle. While coronary thrombosis is a common cause of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), it is possible for a thrombus to form in a coronary artery without resulting in myocardial infarction. In some cases, the thrombus may partially occlude the artery or may dissolve on its own before causing significant damage to the heart muscle.

Therefore, the presence of coronary thrombosis without resulting in myocardial infarction does not definitively indicate the presence of Acute Myocardial Infarction. Additional diagnostic criteria such as clinical symptoms, ECG findings, and cardiac biomarkers are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of AMI."
Exacerbation of coronary arteriosclerosis,1340292,False,"No

Rationale: An exacerbation of coronary arteriosclerosis refers to a worsening or flare-up of the underlying condition of coronary artery disease, which is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While exacerbation of coronary arteriosclerosis can increase the likelihood of developing AMI, it is not specific to AMI. Many individuals with exacerbation of coronary arteriosclerosis may not necessarily go on to have a heart attack. Therefore, having an exacerbation of coronary arteriosclerosis does not definitively mean that an individual has AMI."
Chronic ischemic heart disease,315286,False,"No, chronic ischemic heart disease is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Chronic ischemic heart disease refers to a condition where there is a long-standing reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle due to coronary artery disease. This can lead to symptoms such as chest pain (angina) and shortness of breath. While chronic ischemic heart disease can increase the risk of having a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction), not everyone with chronic ischemic heart disease will necessarily have an acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, the presence of chronic ischemic heart disease does not definitively indicate the presence of an acute myocardial infarction."
Post-infarction mitral papillary muscle rupture,4119462,True,"Yes, post-infarction mitral papillary muscle rupture is specific to acute myocardial infarction. 

Rationale: Post-infarction mitral papillary muscle rupture is a complication that can occur following an acute myocardial infarction. The rupture of the papillary muscle leads to acute mitral regurgitation, which can exacerbate the already compromised cardiac function in the setting of a heart attack. Therefore, if a patient has post-infarction mitral papillary muscle rupture, it is highly likely that they have experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Atrial septal defect due to and following acute myocardial infarction,438172,False,"No

Rationale:
An atrial septal defect is a congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormal opening in the atrial septum that separates the two upper chambers of the heart. This condition is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is typically present from birth. While it is possible for a patient with AMI to develop complications such as atrial septal defect due to the myocardial infarction, it is not a defining characteristic of AMI. Therefore, the presence of an atrial septal defect following AMI does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Rupture of chordae tendineae,438171,False,"No, the condition ""Rupture of chordae tendineae"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Rupture of chordae tendineae refers to the tearing or breaking of the fibrous cords that anchor the heart valves to the heart muscle. While this condition can lead to complications such as mitral valve regurgitation and heart failure, it is not a defining characteristic of AMI. AMI is specifically related to the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis, which is not directly caused by chordae tendineae rupture. Therefore, having a rupture of chordae tendineae does not definitively mean that a person has experienced an AMI."
Cardiac arrest during surgery,37398951,True,"Yes, cardiac arrest during surgery is specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). 

Cardiac arrest during surgery can be a complication of AMI, as the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue can result in a life-threatening event such as cardiac arrest. Additionally, the symptoms of AMI, such as severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, can also manifest during a cardiac arrest event. Therefore, if a patient experiences cardiac arrest during surgery, it is highly likely that they have an underlying AMI."
Preinfarction syndrome,315296,False,"No, preinfarction syndrome is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Preinfarction syndrome refers to a set of symptoms that may occur before a heart attack, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. While these symptoms can be indicative of an impending heart attack, they are not exclusive to AMI and can also be present in other cardiac conditions or even non-cardiac issues. Therefore, having preinfarction syndrome does not definitively mean that a person will have an AMI."
Postoperative shock,200618,False,"No

Rationale: Postoperative shock is a condition that can occur after surgery due to various factors such as hypovolemia, sepsis, or cardiogenic causes. While acute myocardial infarction can lead to shock as a complication, not all cases of postoperative shock are specifically due to acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, having postoperative shock does not definitively mean that the individual has had an acute myocardial infarction."
Coronary artery disease due to type 1 diabetes mellitus,609191,True,"Yes, the condition ""Coronary artery disease due to type 1 diabetes mellitus"" is specific to the malady ""Acute Myocardial Infarction."" 

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a well-established risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease, which can ultimately lead to acute myocardial infarction. Individuals with type 1 diabetes are more prone to atherosclerosis and plaque formation in the coronary arteries, increasing their likelihood of experiencing a heart attack. Therefore, if someone has coronary artery disease due to type 1 diabetes mellitus, they are at a higher risk of developing acute myocardial infarction."
Cardiac complication,321462,False,"No, the condition ""cardiac complication"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). A cardiac complication can refer to a wide range of issues affecting the heart, including but not limited to AMI. Other cardiac complications could include arrhythmias, heart failure, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, etc. Therefore, having a cardiac complication does not definitively mean that a person has experienced an AMI."
Anterior subendocardial myocardial infarction,3189643,True,"Yes, the condition of anterior subendocardial myocardial infarction is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale:
An anterior subendocardial myocardial infarction refers to a specific location within the heart where the myocardial infarction has occurred (anterior wall of the heart, involving the innermost layer of the heart muscle). Since acute myocardial infarction is a broader term encompassing all types of heart attacks, including subendocardial infarctions, if a patient has an anterior subendocardial myocardial infarction, they definitely have experienced a heart attack (AMI). However, not all cases of AMI involve an anterior subendocardial infarction, as there are other locations within the heart where infarctions can occur."
Post-infarction pericarditis,4121477,False,"No

Rationale:
Post-infarction pericarditis is a specific condition that can occur following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). It is characterized by inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, which can lead to chest pain that is sharp and pleuritic in nature. While post-infarction pericarditis can be a complication of AMI, not all patients who experience an AMI will develop pericarditis. Therefore, having post-infarction pericarditis does not definitively mean that a person has had an AMI."
Mixed myocardial ischemia and infarction,4323202,False,"No

Rationale:
While mixed myocardial ischemia and infarction can be a complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to AMI. Mixed myocardial ischemia and infarction can also occur in other conditions such as unstable angina, coronary artery disease, or myocarditis. Therefore, having mixed myocardial ischemia and infarction does not definitively mean that the individual has AMI."
Postoperative transmural myocardial infarction of inferior wall,4209541,True,"Yes

Rationale: The condition of postoperative transmural myocardial infarction of the inferior wall specifically refers to a myocardial infarction that occurs in the inferior wall of the heart following a surgical procedure. Since acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a broader term that encompasses all types of heart attacks, including those that occur in the inferior wall postoperatively, having this condition would definitively indicate the presence of the malady of AMI. Therefore, if a patient has postoperative transmural myocardial infarction of the inferior wall, they definitely have experienced an acute myocardial infarction."
Ventricular aneurysm,4236169,False,"No, ventricular aneurysm is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). While ventricular aneurysm can be a complication of AMI due to the necrosis of cardiac tissue following a heart attack, it can also occur as a result of other conditions such as hypertension, congenital heart defects, or inflammatory diseases. Therefore, the presence of a ventricular aneurysm does not definitively indicate the presence of AMI."
Inducible ischemia manifest on stress test post myocardial infarction,46273814,True,"Yes, the condition ""Inducible ischemia manifest on stress test post myocardial infarction"" is specific to the malady Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Rationale: The presence of inducible ischemia on a stress test post myocardial infarction indicates ongoing ischemic changes in the heart muscle, which is a direct consequence of the initial myocardial infarction. This condition is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction, as it is a direct sequelae of the occlusion of a coronary artery leading to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue."
Coronary arteriosclerosis due to radiation,4175846,False,"No

Rationale: While coronary arteriosclerosis can contribute to the development of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to this malady. There are various other risk factors and conditions that can lead to AMI, such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and hyperlipidemia. Therefore, having coronary arteriosclerosis due to radiation does not definitively mean that an individual will have an acute myocardial infarction."
Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy due to coronary artery disease,43020660,True,"Yes, the condition of Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy due to coronary artery disease is specific to the malady of Acute Myocardial Infarction. 

Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged due to chronic ischemia, often caused by coronary artery disease. In the context of acute myocardial infarction, the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leads to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue, which can ultimately result in ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Therefore, if a patient has Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy due to coronary artery disease, it is highly likely that they have experienced an acute myocardial infarction in the past."
Rupture of heart,4107225,False,"No

Rationale:
While a rupture of the heart can be a complication of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is not specific to AMI. A rupture of the heart can also occur in other conditions such as trauma, infective endocarditis, or myocarditis. Therefore, having a rupture of the heart does not definitively mean that the individual has experienced an AMI."
Complication,433128,False,"No, the condition ""complication"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Complications can arise from a variety of medical conditions and are not exclusive to AMI. In the context of AMI, complications may include arrhythmias, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and ventricular septal rupture, among others. Therefore, having a complication does not definitively mean that a person has AMI, as complications can occur in other medical conditions as well."
Arteriosclerotic vascular disease,318443,False,"No.

Rationale: Arteriosclerotic vascular disease is a broad term that encompasses various conditions involving the hardening and narrowing of arteries due to the buildup of plaque. While arteriosclerotic vascular disease can contribute to the development of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by causing atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries, it is not specific to AMI. Many other factors, such as plaque rupture and thrombosis, are involved in the pathogenesis of AMI. Therefore, having arteriosclerotic vascular disease does not definitively mean that an individual will have an AMI."
Syphilitic coronary artery disease,4080593,False,"No

Rationale:
Syphilitic coronary artery disease is a specific condition caused by the tertiary stage of syphilis, where the infection leads to the formation of gummas in the coronary arteries, resulting in stenosis and occlusion. While syphilitic coronary artery disease can lead to myocardial infarction in some cases, not all cases of acute myocardial infarction are caused by syphilitic coronary artery disease. Therefore, having syphilitic coronary artery disease does not definitively mean that one has had an acute myocardial infarction."
Anoxic encephalopathy,377845,False,"No, anoxic encephalopathy is not specific to acute myocardial infarction. Anoxic encephalopathy refers to brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain, which can occur in various medical conditions such as cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, drowning, or severe hypotension. While anoxic encephalopathy can potentially occur as a complication of acute myocardial infarction if there is severe and prolonged lack of oxygen delivery to the brain, it is not a specific indicator of AMI. Other medical conditions can also lead to anoxic encephalopathy, so it is not exclusive to AMI."
Acute disease of cardiovascular system,4028367,False,"No, the condition ""Acute disease of cardiovascular system"" is not specific to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). The term ""acute disease of cardiovascular system"" is a broad category that encompasses various acute conditions affecting the cardiovascular system, including but not limited to AMI. Therefore, having an acute disease of the cardiovascular system does not definitively mean that one has AMI specifically. It is important to consider the specific symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and clinical findings associated with AMI to make a more accurate diagnosis."
Postoperative transmural myocardial infarction,35610089,True,"Yes, postoperative transmural myocardial infarction is specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 

Postoperative transmural myocardial infarction refers to a heart attack that occurs after a surgical procedure. In this context, the condition is a specific manifestation of AMI, as it involves the sudden occlusion of a coronary artery leading to ischemia and necrosis of cardiac tissue. The underlying pathophysiology and clinical presentation of postoperative transmural myocardial infarction align with those of AMI, including the release of cardiac biomarkers, ECG changes, and symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath. Therefore, if a patient is diagnosed with postoperative transmural myocardial infarction, they definitely have the malady of acute myocardial infarction."
Postoperative nontransmural myocardial infarction,35610087,False,"No

Rationale:
Postoperative nontransmural myocardial infarction is a specific type of myocardial infarction that occurs after surgery but does not involve the full thickness of the heart muscle. While it is a type of myocardial infarction, it is not specific to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). There are various causes of myocardial infarction, and postoperative nontransmural myocardial infarction can occur in the absence of the typical presentation of AMI, such as sudden occlusion of a coronary artery. Therefore, having postoperative nontransmural myocardial infarction does not definitively mean that one has AMI."
