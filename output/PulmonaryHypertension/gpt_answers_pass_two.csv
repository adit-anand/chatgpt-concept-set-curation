Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome,4161597,True,"Yes, Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and long QT interval on electrocardiogram, which predisposes affected individuals to life-threatening arrhythmias. In addition to these features, individuals with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome can also develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a person has Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, they definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Atrioventricular septal defect and common atrioventricular junction,4100152,True,"Yes, the condition of Atrioventricular septal defect and common atrioventricular junction is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Atrioventricular septal defect and common atrioventricular junction are congenital heart defects that can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, ultimately causing pulmonary hypertension. Patients with these conditions are at an increased risk of developing PH due to the abnormal blood flow and pressure within the heart and lungs. Therefore, if a patient has Atrioventricular septal defect and common atrioventricular junction, they are likely to develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a result."
Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure,37016114,False,"No

Rationale: Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by a sudden worsening of respiratory function in a patient with pre-existing chronic respiratory insufficiency. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to chronic hypoxemia and respiratory failure, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will develop acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure. Therefore, the presence of acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Neonatal cardiac failure due to pulmonary overperfusion,37110330,True,"Yes, neonatal cardiac failure due to pulmonary overperfusion is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Neonatal cardiac failure due to pulmonary overperfusion is a condition where there is excessive blood flow to the lungs, leading to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. This increased pressure can ultimately lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which are characteristic features of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a neonate presents with cardiac failure due to pulmonary overperfusion, it is highly likely that they have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic acroosteolysis,4214861,False,"No, idiopathic acroosteolysis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic acroosteolysis is a rare condition characterized by the resorption of the distal phalanges of the hands and feet, leading to bone loss and deformity. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension or its associated symptoms. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may potentially have idiopathic acroosteolysis as a comorbidity, the presence of idiopathic acroosteolysis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Tricuspid papillary muscle abnormality,4100145,False,"No, a tricuspid papillary muscle abnormality is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While tricuspid regurgitation can be a common finding in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension due to right ventricular dysfunction, a tricuspid papillary muscle abnormality alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation, such as echocardiography and right heart catheterization, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension in this case."
Idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia,45769390,False,"No, idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare inflammatory lung disease characterized by the accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs, leading to respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and fever. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with various conditions, including lung diseases, it is not a defining feature of idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia. Therefore, having idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia does not necessarily mean that a person will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Atrioventricular septal defect associated with tetralogy of Fallot,40487550,False,"No, the condition ""Atrioventricular septal defect associated with tetralogy of Fallot"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with congenital heart defects such as atrioventricular septal defect and tetralogy of Fallot may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all patients with these conditions will go on to develop PH. Pulmonary hypertension can have various etiologies, including but not limited to congenital heart defects. Therefore, having the condition does not definitively mean that the patient has the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Langerhans cell histiocytosis,4278365,False,"No.

Rationale: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the abnormal proliferation of Langerhans cells in various tissues. While it can affect the lungs and cause pulmonary involvement, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having Langerhans cell histiocytosis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Heart failure as a complication of care,4124705,False,"No, heart failure as a complication of care is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While heart failure can be a potential complication of Pulmonary Hypertension due to the strain on the right ventricle, it is not exclusive to this condition. Heart failure can have various causes such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and other cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having heart failure as a complication of care does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypertrophy of tunica vaginalis,4323427,False,"No, hypertrophy of tunica vaginalis is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Hypertrophy of tunica vaginalis refers to an enlargement of the tunica vaginalis, which is a membrane that covers the testis. This condition is not related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Therefore, having hypertrophy of tunica vaginalis does not necessarily mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congenital ventricular septal defect,35625532,True,"Yes, a congenital ventricular septal defect is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

A congenital ventricular septal defect is a type of congenital heart defect where there is an abnormal opening in the septum (wall) between the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). This defect can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension over time. In the context of the malady of pulmonary hypertension, having a congenital ventricular septal defect can definitely contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has a congenital ventricular septal defect, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result."
Cardiovascular system hereditary disorder,4179992,False,"No, the condition ""Cardiovascular system hereditary disorder"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can be hereditary in some cases, not all hereditary cardiovascular disorders lead to Pulmonary Hypertension. There are various hereditary cardiovascular disorders that can present with different symptoms and complications, so having a hereditary cardiovascular disorder does not definitively mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension in a patient with a hereditary cardiovascular disorder."
Pulmonary artery stenosis,4317288,True,"Yes, pulmonary artery stenosis is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary artery stenosis refers to a narrowing of the pulmonary artery, which can lead to increased pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. This increased pressure can contribute to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has pulmonary artery stenosis, they may develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a result of this condition."
Heart disease,321588,False,"No, heart disease is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, heart disease is a broad term that encompasses a variety of conditions affecting the heart, including coronary artery disease, heart rhythm disorders, and structural heart defects. Pulmonary hypertension is a specific condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which can result from various underlying causes. Therefore, having heart disease does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Fibrosclerosis - systemic,4343922,False,"No, fibrosclerosis - systemic is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Fibrosclerosis is a condition characterized by the abnormal formation of fibrous tissue in various organs and tissues throughout the body. While fibrosis can occur in the lungs and contribute to pulmonary hypertension, it is not a specific indicator of the condition. Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically defined by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which may or may not be associated with fibrosclerosis in other organs. Therefore, having fibrosclerosis - systemic does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Inflammation of tunica vaginalis,42537652,False,"No, inflammation of the tunica vaginalis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Inflammation of the tunica vaginalis refers to inflammation of the serous membrane that covers the testis and is typically associated with conditions such as epididymitis or testicular torsion. It is not a known symptom or sign of pulmonary hypertension."
Malaligned outlet septum,4141179,False,"No, malaligned outlet septum is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Malaligned outlet septum refers to a congenital heart defect where the outlet septum is not properly aligned, leading to abnormalities in the structure of the heart. While congenital heart defects can be associated with Pulmonary Hypertension, having a malaligned outlet septum does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to determine if Pulmonary Hypertension is present in a patient with a malaligned outlet septum."
Idiopathic chloasma,4196360,False,"No.

Rationale:
Idiopathic chloasma is a condition characterized by the development of brown patches on the skin, typically on the face. It is a benign condition that is not related to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have skin changes as a result of decreased oxygenation, idiopathic chloasma is not a specific symptom or sign of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic chloasma does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiac insufficiency during AND/OR resulting from a procedure,4233224,False,"No, cardiac insufficiency during and/or resulting from a procedure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right heart failure as a complication of the disease, cardiac insufficiency during or after a procedure can be caused by a variety of factors unrelated to PH, such as underlying heart disease, arrhythmias, or complications of the procedure itself. Therefore, the presence of cardiac insufficiency during or after a procedure does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Induced termination of pregnancy complicated by cardiac failure,43530961,True,"Yes, the condition ""Induced termination of pregnancy complicated by cardiac failure"" is specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, which can be exacerbated by conditions such as induced termination of pregnancy. In this case, the cardiac failure complicating the induced termination of pregnancy would likely be due to the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has the condition of induced termination of pregnancy complicated by cardiac failure, they would definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Sudden idiopathic hearing loss,37110393,False,"No.

Rationale: Sudden idiopathic hearing loss is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have various symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, syncope, and signs of right heart failure, sudden idiopathic hearing loss is not a common symptom associated with this condition. Therefore, the presence of sudden idiopathic hearing loss does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic choroidal neovascular membrane,4194320,False,"No, idiopathic choroidal neovascular membrane is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Choroidal neovascular membrane is a condition involving the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye, which can lead to vision loss. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, and having idiopathic choroidal neovascular membrane does not necessarily mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Abscess of connective tissue,4227090,False,"No, an abscess of connective tissue is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. An abscess of connective tissue is a localized collection of pus within the connective tissue, typically caused by a bacterial infection. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension may potentially develop an abscess of connective tissue as a secondary complication, the presence of an abscess of connective tissue does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic interstitial cystitis,75863,False,"No.

Rationale:
Chronic interstitial cystitis is a condition that affects the bladder, causing symptoms such as pelvic pain, urinary urgency, and frequency. It is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension, which primarily affects the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular function. While patients with chronic interstitial cystitis may have other comorbidities, there is no direct link between these two conditions. Therefore, having chronic interstitial cystitis does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Corneal stromal degeneration,4171880,False,"No

Rationale: Corneal stromal degeneration is a condition affecting the cornea of the eye, which is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbidities or conditions, corneal stromal degeneration is not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiac anomaly and heterotaxy syndrome,36715118,False,"No, the condition ""Cardiac anomaly and heterotaxy syndrome"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with heterotaxy syndrome may have cardiac anomalies that can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all patients with cardiac anomalies and heterotaxy syndrome will develop pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can have various causes, as mentioned in the description of the malady, and it is not solely linked to cardiac anomalies and heterotaxy syndrome. Therefore, having the condition does not definitively mean that the individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic aplastic anemia,4098145,False,"No, idiopathic aplastic anemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic aplastic anemia is a condition characterized by bone marrow failure, leading to a decrease in the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It is not directly related to the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature seen in pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop anemia as a secondary complication, the presence of idiopathic aplastic anemia does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Tripartite right ventricle,40487478,False,"No, a tripartite right ventricle is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While right ventricular dysfunction is a common feature of pulmonary hypertension, a tripartite right ventricle refers to a specific anatomical variation in the right ventricle where it is divided into three distinct parts. This anatomical variation can be present in individuals with or without pulmonary hypertension, and therefore having a tripartite right ventricle does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in a patient with a tripartite right ventricle."
Peripheral pulmonary artery disease,4354083,False,"No

Rationale: Peripheral pulmonary artery disease is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, peripheral pulmonary artery disease refers to blockages or narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the lungs. While these conditions may be related in some cases, having peripheral pulmonary artery disease does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Diastolic heart failure stage A,43531001,False,"No, diastolic heart failure stage A is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Diastolic heart failure refers to a condition where the heart's ability to relax and fill with blood is impaired, leading to symptoms of heart failure. Stage A refers to individuals who are at risk for heart failure but do not yet have structural heart abnormalities or symptoms. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, diastolic heart failure stage A is a separate condition that can have various causes, including hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Therefore, having diastolic heart failure stage A does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic atrophic hypothyroidism,4309027,False,"No, idiopathic atrophic hypothyroidism is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic atrophic hypothyroidism refers to a condition where the thyroid gland is underactive for unknown reasons, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. While thyroid dysfunction can contribute to cardiovascular issues, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily related to elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right heart dysfunction. Therefore, having idiopathic atrophic hypothyroidism does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Systolic heart failure stage A,43531002,False,"No, systolic heart failure stage A is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Systolic heart failure stage A refers to individuals who are at high risk for developing heart failure but do not have structural heart abnormalities or symptoms of heart failure. This condition does not specifically indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension, as PH is a separate and distinct condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. While individuals with PH may develop right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, not all individuals with systolic heart failure stage A will go on to develop PH. Therefore, having systolic heart failure stage A does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic detrusor overactivity,37206611,False,"No.

Rationale: Idiopathic detrusor overactivity is a condition related to the bladder and urinary system, characterized by involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle leading to urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence. It is not directly related to the pulmonary vasculature or right ventricular dysfunction, which are key features of Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may experience symptoms such as fatigue and syncope, the presence of idiopathic detrusor overactivity alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Primary alveolar hypoventilation,4225061,False,"No

Rationale: Primary alveolar hypoventilation, also known as Ondine's curse, is a rare condition characterized by a decrease in ventilation during sleep, leading to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right heart failure and subsequent hypoventilation, primary alveolar hypoventilation is not a specific condition associated with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having primary alveolar hypoventilation does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary embolism,440417,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary embolism is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary embolism can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all individuals with pulmonary embolism will develop pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary embolism is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs, usually caused by a blood clot that travels to the lungs from another part of the body. It presents with symptoms such as sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing up blood. Diagnosis is typically confirmed with imaging studies such as CT pulmonary angiography. Treatment involves anticoagulant therapy to prevent further clot formation."
Pulmonary vein dilatation,40491522,False,"No, pulmonary vein dilatation is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary vein dilatation refers to the enlargement or dilation of the pulmonary veins, which can be seen on imaging studies such as CT scans or MRIs. While pulmonary vein dilatation can be seen in conditions such as pulmonary hypertension, it is not a specific or definitive indicator of Pulmonary Hypertension. Other conditions such as left heart disease or chronic thromboembolic disease can also cause pulmonary vein dilatation. Therefore, the presence of pulmonary vein dilatation alone does not necessarily mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Pleural effusion,254061,False,"No

Rationale: Pleural effusion is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space surrounding the lungs. While pleural effusion can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension, it is not a specific condition that definitively indicates the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pleural effusion can have various causes, including heart failure, infections, malignancies, and liver disease, among others. Therefore, the presence of pleural effusion does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Sepsis-associated left ventricular failure,4079695,False,"No.

Rationale: Pulmonary Hypertension primarily affects the right side of the heart, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Sepsis-associated left ventricular failure, on the other hand, specifically involves dysfunction of the left ventricle of the heart due to sepsis. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop right heart failure, the condition itself is not directly associated with left ventricular failure due to sepsis. Therefore, having sepsis-associated left ventricular failure does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Congestive heart failure as early postoperative complication,44784345,False,"No. 

Congestive heart failure as an early postoperative complication is a condition that can occur after various types of surgeries, including cardiac surgeries. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of congestive heart failure as an early postoperative complication are specifically due to pulmonary hypertension. There are multiple other causes of congestive heart failure, such as coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, or myocardial infarction, that can also lead to this condition. Therefore, having congestive heart failure as an early postoperative complication does not definitively mean that the individual has pulmonary hypertension."
False tendon - heart,4130892,False,"No, false tendon in the heart is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. False tendons are thin bands of fibrous tissue that can be found in the heart, particularly in the left ventricle. They are considered a normal variant and are typically harmless, not directly related to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction, the presence of false tendons in the heart does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic sleep related non-obstructive alveolar hypoventilation,40481299,False,"No.

Rationale: Idiopathic sleep-related non-obstructive alveolar hypoventilation is a specific condition related to abnormal breathing during sleep, characterized by decreased ventilation without an obstruction in the airway. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as it is not a defining feature or symptom of PH. While patients with PH may experience sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea, idiopathic sleep-related non-obstructive alveolar hypoventilation is a distinct condition that is not directly linked to PH."
Bosley Salih Alorainy syndrome,36715086,False,"No, Bosley Salih Alorainy syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Bosley Salih Alorainy syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, and distinctive facial features. There is no known association between Bosley Salih Alorainy syndrome and Pulmonary Hypertension based on current medical knowledge."
PFAPA syndrome,37397178,False,"No

Rationale: PFAPA syndrome (Periodic Fever, Aphthous stomatitis, Pharyngitis, and Adenitis) is a periodic fever syndrome that typically presents in childhood with recurrent episodes of fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers, and swollen glands. It is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension, as it primarily affects the respiratory and lymphatic systems rather than the pulmonary vasculature. While a patient with PFAPA syndrome may also have pulmonary hypertension, the presence of PFAPA syndrome does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Mass of soft tissue,40481517,False,"No, a mass of soft tissue is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with PH may present with symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and signs of right heart failure, a mass of soft tissue is not a typical or specific symptom of PH. A mass of soft tissue may indicate other conditions such as tumors, cysts, or inflammatory processes, which would require further evaluation and testing to determine the underlying cause."
Obscure gastrointestinal hemorrhage,36717237,False,"No

Rationale: Obscure gastrointestinal hemorrhage is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop gastrointestinal bleeding as a complication of their condition, the presence of obscure gastrointestinal hemorrhage does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. It is important to consider other potential causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as peptic ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease, or vascular malformations, before attributing it to pulmonary hypertension."
Effect of exposure to physical force,4167864,False,"No, the condition ""Effect of exposure to physical force"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While physical force or trauma can potentially lead to certain medical conditions or injuries, it is not a defining characteristic or specific symptom of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, rather than being directly caused by exposure to physical force."
Eisenmenger's complex,40403695,True,"Yes, Eisenmenger's complex is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Eisenmenger's complex is a condition that occurs as a result of long-standing untreated or poorly managed congenital heart defects, leading to the development of pulmonary hypertension. In Eisenmenger's complex, the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature causes a reversal of blood flow from right to left, leading to cyanosis and right heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has Eisenmenger's complex, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension as it is a direct consequence of the condition."
Disseminated idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis,77961,False,"No, Disseminated idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. DISH is a non-inflammatory condition characterized by abnormal bone growth along the spine and other areas of the body. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension may potentially have DISH as a comorbidity, having DISH does not necessarily mean that a person will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Primary endocardial fibroelastosis of right ventricle,4100278,False,"No.

Rationale:
Primary endocardial fibroelastosis of the right ventricle is a rare condition characterized by thickening of the endocardium of the right ventricle, leading to impaired ventricular function. While this condition may lead to right heart failure, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can have various causes, and primary endocardial fibroelastosis of the right ventricle is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having primary endocardial fibroelastosis of the right ventricle does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic resorption of root of tooth,44784166,False,"No, idiopathic resorption of the root of a tooth is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic resorption of the root of a tooth is a dental condition characterized by the spontaneous breakdown and destruction of the root of a tooth without any known cause. This condition is not related to the pathophysiology or symptoms of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic stabbing headache,374922,False,"No, idiopathic stabbing headache is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Idiopathic stabbing headache, also known as primary stabbing headache or ice pick headache, is a type of headache characterized by short, sharp, stabbing pains in the head. It is typically a benign and self-limited condition that does not have a known underlying cause. While headaches can be a symptom of various medical conditions, including Pulmonary Hypertension, idiopathic stabbing headache is not a defining symptom of PH. Therefore, having idiopathic stabbing headache does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic factor VIII deficiency,4141230,False,"No, idiopathic factor VIII deficiency is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic factor VIII deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency of factor VIII, a protein necessary for blood clotting. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbidities, idiopathic factor VIII deficiency is not a known associated condition."
Chronic pulmonary edema,4188331,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic pulmonary edema is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary edema can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension due to right heart failure, it can also be caused by other conditions such as heart failure, kidney disease, or lung diseases. Therefore, having chronic pulmonary edema does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Premenopausal idiopathic osteopenia,42539551,False,"No, premenopausal idiopathic osteopenia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Premenopausal idiopathic osteopenia refers to decreased bone mineral density in premenopausal women of unknown cause. While osteopenia can be associated with certain conditions such as osteoporosis, it is not a direct symptom or sign of pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions are not directly related in terms of pathophysiology or presentation."
Congestive heart failure as post-operative complication of non-cardiac surgery,762003,False,"No, congestive heart failure as a post-operative complication of non-cardiac surgery is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, congestive heart failure as a post-operative complication of non-cardiac surgery can have various causes, including pre-existing heart conditions, fluid overload, or stress on the heart from the surgery itself. Therefore, having congestive heart failure as a post-operative complication of non-cardiac surgery does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Congestive heart failure as post-operative complication of cardiac surgery,762002,False,"No, congestive heart failure as a post-operative complication of cardiac surgery is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, congestive heart failure as a post-operative complication of cardiac surgery can have various causes, including but not limited to pulmonary hypertension. It is important to consider other factors such as underlying heart disease, surgical complications, and other comorbidities when assessing the development of congestive heart failure post-cardiac surgery."
Dilatation of right atrioventricular valve annulus,4100263,False,"No, dilatation of the right atrioventricular valve annulus is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While right heart enlargement and dysfunction can occur in patients with pulmonary hypertension, dilatation of the right atrioventricular valve annulus can be seen in a variety of cardiac conditions, not just pulmonary hypertension. It is important to consider other factors and diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause of the valve annulus dilatation."
Benign hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure,313502,False,"No, the condition ""Benign hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension specifically refers to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. The condition ""Benign hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure"" refers to a different type of heart disease related to high blood pressure affecting the heart muscle, but it does not specifically involve the pulmonary vasculature or right heart dysfunction as seen in Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having the condition ""Benign hypertensive heart disease without congestive heart failure"" does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Thromboembolic disorder,4159647,False,"No, thromboembolic disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While chronic thromboembolic disease is mentioned as an exclusion for pulmonary arterial hypertension, thromboembolic disorder is a broad term that encompasses a variety of conditions involving blood clots forming and traveling through the bloodstream. While thromboembolic disorders can potentially lead to pulmonary hypertension if left untreated, they are not specific to this particular malady."
Idiopathic arterial calcification of infancy,4288737,True,"Yes, idiopathic arterial calcification of infancy is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Idiopathic arterial calcification of infancy is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by extensive calcification of the internal elastic lamina of medium and large arteries, leading to arterial stenosis and hypertension. This condition can result in pulmonary hypertension as a complication of the arterial calcification. Therefore, if a patient has idiopathic arterial calcification of infancy, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a consequence of the arterial calcification."
Hypercapnic respiratory failure,46271074,True,"Yes, hypercapnic respiratory failure can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Hypercapnic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by an elevated level of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can occur in patients with advanced pulmonary hypertension due to the impaired gas exchange and ventilation-perfusion abnormalities associated with the disease. In pulmonary hypertension, the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure can lead to decreased blood flow to the lungs, impairing the ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide effectively. This can result in hypercapnia, which is a common complication in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and can contribute to respiratory failure. Therefore, if a patient with pulmonary hypertension develops hypercapnic respiratory failure, it is highly likely that the two conditions are related."
Sporadic idiopathic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome,37397147,False,"No.

Rationale: Sporadic idiopathic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome is a kidney disorder characterized by the presence of protein in the urine, low levels of protein in the blood, high cholesterol levels, and swelling. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as they affect different organ systems and have distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may or may not have sporadic idiopathic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, having the latter condition does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure,46271075,False,"No, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by a low oxygen level in the blood, which can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism, or heart failure. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to hypoxemia and respiratory failure, there are many other conditions that can also cause these symptoms. Therefore, having acute hypoxemic respiratory failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic hypertrophy of bone,4069533,False,"No, idiopathic hypertrophy of bone is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hypertrophy of bone refers to a condition characterized by abnormal growth of bone tissue without a known cause. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other underlying conditions, idiopathic hypertrophy of bone is not a defining feature of this disease."
Familial disease,4008090,True,"Yes, the condition of familial disease can be specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. Familial Pulmonary Hypertension refers to cases where there is a genetic predisposition for developing the condition. In these cases, if a family member has been diagnosed with Pulmonary Hypertension due to a genetic mutation, other family members may also be at risk for developing the condition. Therefore, if someone has the familial condition of a genetic predisposition for Pulmonary Hypertension, they are likely to have the malady as well."
Poikiloderma due to connective tissue disease,4301030,False,"No.

Rationale:
Poikiloderma due to connective tissue disease is a skin condition characterized by a combination of hyperpigmentation, telangiectasia, and atrophy. While connective tissue diseases can be associated with pulmonary hypertension, the presence of poikiloderma alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in a patient with poikiloderma due to connective tissue disease."
Saddle embolus of pulmonary artery,36713113,True,"Yes, a saddle embolus of the pulmonary artery is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

A saddle embolus of the pulmonary artery refers to a large blood clot that is lodged at the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery, obstructing blood flow to both lungs. This condition can lead to acute right heart strain and potentially right heart failure, which are complications of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has a saddle embolus of the pulmonary artery, they definitely have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Portal hypertension,192680,False,"No

Rationale: Portal hypertension is a condition characterized by increased pressure in the portal vein system, which carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver. While both portal hypertension and pulmonary hypertension involve elevated blood pressure, they occur in different vascular systems (portal vein system vs. pulmonary vasculature) and have different underlying causes and manifestations. Therefore, having portal hypertension does not necessarily mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic sclerosing lipogranuloma,4301035,False,"No, idiopathic sclerosing lipogranuloma is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic sclerosing lipogranuloma is a rare benign inflammatory condition characterized by the presence of nodules or masses composed of fibrous tissue, fat, and inflammatory cells.

This condition is a specific genetic syndrome known as CHIME syndrome, which is characterized by coloboma (a hole in one of the structures of the eye), congenital heart disease, ichthyosiform dermatosis (a skin condition characterized by dry, scaly skin), intellectual disability, and ear anomalies. While some individuals with CHIME syndrome may have heart defects that could potentially lead to pulmonary hypertension, not all individuals with this syndrome will develop PH. Pulmonary Hypertension is a separate and distinct condition that can have various causes, as outlined in the description provided. Therefore, having CHIME syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Lymphangiomyomatosis of connective tissue,37016194,False,"No, lymphangiomyomatosis of connective tissue is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Lymphangiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease characterized by the abnormal growth of smooth muscle cells in the lungs, leading to the formation of cysts and progressive respiratory symptoms. While LAM can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication of advanced disease, not all patients with LAM will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having lymphangiomyomatosis of connective tissue does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
"Obesity, colitis, hypothyroidism, cardiac hypertrophy, developmental delay syndrome",36717199,False,"No, the condition ""Obesity"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While obesity is a risk factor for developing PH, not all individuals with obesity will develop PH. PH can have various causes, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having obesity does not definitively mean that an individual has PH."
Congenital heart disease in pregnancy,4129018,False,"No

Rationale: Congenital heart disease in pregnancy is a condition that refers to women who have a pre-existing congenital heart defect and are pregnant. While congenital heart disease can be a risk factor for developing pulmonary hypertension, not all individuals with congenital heart disease will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having congenital heart disease in pregnancy does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Obstruction of pulmonary great vein due to compression by right atrial dilatation,43020888,False,"No.

The condition described, obstruction of the pulmonary great vein due to compression by right atrial dilatation, is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While it may be a potential complication or associated finding in some cases of pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, the presence of this specific condition does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Atherosclerosis of coronary artery without angina pectoris,764123,False,"No, atherosclerosis of coronary artery without angina pectoris is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Atherosclerosis of the coronary artery is a condition that involves the buildup of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle, leading to potential blockages and reduced blood flow to the heart. This condition is more commonly associated with coronary artery disease and can lead to complications such as heart attacks. While there may be some overlap in risk factors for atherosclerosis and Pulmonary Hypertension, they are distinct conditions with different pathophysiology and clinical presentations."
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder,4208786,False,"No, a musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have underlying conditions such as connective tissue diseases that can contribute to the development of PH, having a musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension requires specific hemodynamic criteria and diagnostic testing as outlined in the description of the malady."
Chronic right-sided congestive heart failure,4284562,True,"Yes, chronic right-sided congestive heart failure is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Chronic right-sided congestive heart failure is a condition that can result from pulmonary hypertension, as the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has chronic right-sided congestive heart failure, it is likely that they also have pulmonary hypertension. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will develop chronic right-sided congestive heart failure, as the progression of the disease can vary."
Disorder of cardiac function,4024552,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of cardiac function"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, there are many other conditions that can also cause disorders of cardiac function. Therefore, having a disorder of cardiac function does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini,46273047,False,"No.

Rationale: Idiopathic atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini is a rare skin condition characterized by well-defined, depressed areas of skin that are usually asymptomatic. There is no known association between this skin condition and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic hepatitis in infancy,4079849,False,"No, idiopathic hepatitis in infancy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hepatitis in infancy refers to inflammation of the liver of unknown cause in infants. While liver dysfunction can lead to complications such as pulmonary hypertension, the presence of idiopathic hepatitis in infancy does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension has specific diagnostic criteria related to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, right ventricular dysfunction, and characteristic symptoms that are not necessarily directly related to idiopathic hepatitis in infancy."
Infective endocarditis of right ventricular wall,43020876,False,"No.

Rationale: Pulmonary Hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. While infective endocarditis of the right ventricular wall can potentially lead to right heart failure, it is not a specific condition that is always present in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension. Infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium, typically involving heart valves, and can affect any chamber of the heart, including the right ventricle. Therefore, while infective endocarditis can lead to similar symptoms as Pulmonary Hypertension, it is not a specific condition that is always present in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension."
Corneal keloid,4305056,False,"No

Rationale: Corneal keloid is a condition characterized by the growth of abnormal scar tissue on the cornea of the eye. This condition is specific to the eye and does not have a direct association with pulmonary hypertension, which primarily affects the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular function. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbidities or conditions, corneal keloid is not a known symptom or complication of pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic idiopathic pain syndrome,42539629,False,"No, chronic idiopathic pain syndrome is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic idiopathic pain syndrome refers to persistent pain without a clear cause or explanation. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience symptoms such as chest pain, the presence of chronic idiopathic pain syndrome does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a specific medical condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, which requires specific diagnostic criteria and evaluation for confirmation."
Chronic kidney disease,46271022,False,"No, chronic kidney disease is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While chronic kidney disease can be a comorbidity or complication of pulmonary hypertension due to the strain it places on the heart and kidneys, having chronic kidney disease does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions can coexist but are not directly linked in a way that one condition always leads to the other."
Malignant hypertensive heart AND renal disease,442603,False,"No, the condition of malignant hypertensive heart AND renal disease is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Malignant hypertensive heart AND renal disease refers to a severe form of high blood pressure that affects both the heart and kidneys. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, it is primarily focused on the pulmonary vasculature and does not specifically involve renal disease. Additionally, the diagnostic criteria for Pulmonary Hypertension do not include the presence of malignant hypertensive heart AND renal disease. Therefore, having malignant hypertensive heart AND renal disease does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
"High risk of heart failure, stage B",43530856,False,"No, the condition ""High risk of heart failure, stage B"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can ultimately lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, the condition of high risk of heart failure, stage B is a general classification used to identify individuals who are at risk of developing heart failure based on certain criteria such as structural heart disease or symptoms. This condition is not exclusive to Pulmonary Hypertension and can be present in various other cardiac conditions as well."
Pulmonary apoplexy,4001998,False,"No, pulmonary apoplexy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary apoplexy refers to hemorrhage into the lung tissue, which can be caused by various conditions such as pulmonary embolism, lung cancer, or vasculitis. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to complications such as pulmonary hemorrhage, the presence of pulmonary apoplexy does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to determine if pulmonary hypertension is present in a patient with pulmonary apoplexy."
Mucous cyst,3170508,False,"No, a mucous cyst is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

A mucous cyst, also known as a mucous retention cyst, is a common benign cyst that typically occurs on the fingers or toes. It is caused by the blockage of a mucous gland, leading to the accumulation of mucous fluid and the formation of a cyst. This condition is unrelated to the complex pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Therefore, the presence of a mucous cyst does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Obstruction of surgically constructed pulmonary venous pathway as complication of procedure,43020909,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described, obstruction of a surgically constructed pulmonary venous pathway as a complication of a procedure, is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While it may be a potential complication in some cases, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The condition described does not necessarily indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
At risk for heart failure,43530854,False,"No, being at risk for heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can ultimately lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, being at risk for heart failure can be due to a variety of other factors such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, or valvular heart disease. Therefore, having the condition of being at risk for heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
"High risk of heart failure, stage A",43530855,False,"No, the condition ""High risk of heart failure, stage A"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may ultimately develop right heart failure as a complication of the disease, the condition of being at high risk for heart failure stage A is a general risk factor for developing heart failure and can be present in various other cardiac conditions as well. It does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic congestive heart failure,4229440,False,"No, chronic congestive heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of chronic congestive heart failure are caused by pulmonary hypertension. Chronic congestive heart failure can have various causes, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and other cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having chronic congestive heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Seborrhea adiposa,4274496,False,"No, seborrhea adiposa is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Seborrhea adiposa is a skin condition characterized by excessive oiliness of the skin, often leading to dandruff and greasy hair. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience a variety of symptoms, seborrhea adiposa is not a defining characteristic of the disease."
Benign hypertensive heart AND renal disease,442626,False,"No, the condition ""Benign hypertensive heart AND renal disease"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension specifically refers to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The condition ""Benign hypertensive heart AND renal disease"" refers to a condition involving both the heart and kidneys due to high blood pressure, which is different from the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop heart failure, it is not directly related to renal disease as in the condition mentioned. Therefore, having ""Benign hypertensive heart AND renal disease"" does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Erythrocytosis due to cyanotic congenital heart disease,4131130,True,"Yes, the condition of Erythrocytosis due to cyanotic congenital heart disease is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Erythrocytosis, or an increase in red blood cell count, can occur as a compensatory mechanism in response to chronic hypoxia, which is commonly seen in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. This chronic hypoxia can lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction and ultimately pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has erythrocytosis due to cyanotic congenital heart disease, they are likely to develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of the underlying heart condition. 

In contrast, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have erythrocytosis due to cyanotic congenital heart disease, as there are various other causes of pulmonary hypertension as mentioned in the description of the malady."
Renal medullary washout,4153653,False,"No

Rationale: Renal medullary washout is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. It is a radiological finding seen on contrast-enhanced CT scans of the abdomen, typically indicating renal ischemia or infarction. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right heart failure and potentially affect renal function, renal medullary washout is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension."
Systolic heart failure stage B due to ischemic cardiomyopathy,36717359,False,"No, the condition ""Systolic heart failure stage B due to ischemic cardiomyopathy"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure as a result of the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, the specific etiology mentioned in the condition (ischemic cardiomyopathy) refers to heart failure caused by coronary artery disease leading to inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle. While there can be overlap in symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, the underlying causes and diagnostic criteria for these two conditions are distinct. Therefore, having systolic heart failure stage B due to ischemic cardiomyopathy does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Septic pulmonary embolism,40479606,False,"No, septic pulmonary embolism is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Septic pulmonary embolism is a condition characterized by infected emboli in the pulmonary vasculature, often originating from a distant source of infection such as endocarditis or intravenous drug use. While septic pulmonary embolism can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all patients with septic pulmonary embolism will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having septic pulmonary embolism does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Dependence on supplemental oxygen when ambulating,46273505,True,"Yes, dependence on supplemental oxygen when ambulating can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may experience symptoms such as dyspnea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, which can be exacerbated with physical activity. As the disease progresses, the right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure associated with PH can lead to decreased exercise tolerance and the need for supplemental oxygen to support oxygenation during ambulation. Therefore, if a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension is dependent on supplemental oxygen when ambulating, it is highly likely that they have the malady."
Idiopathic bilateral vestibulopathy,42537903,False,"No, idiopathic bilateral vestibulopathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic bilateral vestibulopathy is a condition characterized by dysfunction of the vestibular system in both inner ears, leading to symptoms such as imbalance, vertigo, and unsteadiness. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience symptoms such as dizziness or lightheadedness, idiopathic bilateral vestibulopathy is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. These two conditions involve different physiological systems and etiologies, making them distinct entities."
Undifferentiated connective tissue disease,4344165,True,"Yes, undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) can be specific to pulmonary hypertension (PH). UCTD is a condition characterized by symptoms and signs of connective tissue disease (such as joint pain, skin rashes, and fatigue) that do not meet the criteria for a specific diagnosis like lupus or scleroderma. However, UCTD can be associated with pulmonary hypertension, as connective tissue diseases are one of the etiologies of PH mentioned in the description. Therefore, if a patient has UCTD, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their underlying connective tissue disease."
Idiopathic hypopituitarism,4147477,False,"No, idiopathic hypopituitarism is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hypopituitarism is a condition characterized by a deficiency in one or more pituitary hormones, which can lead to a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and hormonal imbalances. While there may be overlap in symptoms between idiopathic hypopituitarism and pulmonary hypertension, they are distinct conditions with different underlying causes and diagnostic criteria. Pulmonary hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, which are not directly related to pituitary hormone deficiencies."
Disorder of right cardiac ventricle,4165905,True,"Yes, a disorder of the right cardiac ventricle is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. In Pulmonary Hypertension, elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if someone has a disorder of the right cardiac ventricle, they may definitely have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic anterior uveitis,4335981,False,"No, idiopathic anterior uveitis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic anterior uveitis is inflammation of the middle layer of the eye, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or trauma. While there may be associations between certain conditions and idiopathic anterior uveitis, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic anterior uveitis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic diastolic heart failure,40479576,False,"No, chronic diastolic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, chronic diastolic heart failure can have various causes, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and other conditions. Therefore, having chronic diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Congenital central hypoventilation,319793,True,"Yes, congenital central hypoventilation is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a decreased drive to breathe, particularly during sleep. This can lead to low oxygen levels and high carbon dioxide levels in the blood. Patients with CCHS are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension due to chronic hypoxia and respiratory insufficiency. Therefore, if a patient has congenital central hypoventilation, they are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension. On the other hand, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have congenital central hypoventilation."
Idiopathic maternal thrombocytopenia,4159749,False,"No, idiopathic maternal thrombocytopenia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic maternal thrombocytopenia refers to a condition where a pregnant woman has low platelet levels without a known cause. While thrombocytopenia can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension due to issues with blood clotting, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Therefore, having idiopathic maternal thrombocytopenia does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic megaesophagus,36717322,False,"No, idiopathic megaesophagus is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic megaesophagus is a condition characterized by a dilated esophagus that does not have a clear cause. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience symptoms such as dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) due to right heart failure and esophageal dysmotility, idiopathic megaesophagus is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions may coexist in some cases, but having idiopathic megaesophagus does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic idiopathic monocytosis,4329853,False,"No, chronic idiopathic monocytosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic idiopathic monocytosis refers to a condition characterized by persistently elevated levels of monocytes in the blood without an identifiable cause. While chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation have been associated with pulmonary hypertension, chronic idiopathic monocytosis is not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having chronic idiopathic monocytosis does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease,44784621,False,"No, the condition ""Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension specifically refers to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. The condition ""Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease"" refers to a combination of heart disease due to high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as fatigue and fluid retention, the underlying pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria for these conditions are different. Therefore, having ""Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease"" does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic hyperaldosteronism,4122996,False,"No, idiopathic hyperaldosteronism is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hyperaldosteronism is a condition characterized by excessive production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands, leading to hypertension and low potassium levels. While hypertension can be a symptom of pulmonary hypertension, idiopathic hyperaldosteronism is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions have different underlying causes and mechanisms, making idiopathic hyperaldosteronism not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Heart-hand syndrome type 3,36717434,False,"No.

Rationale:
Heart-hand syndrome type 3 is a genetic condition characterized by heart defects and limb abnormalities. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with various underlying conditions, heart-hand syndrome type 3 specifically refers to a genetic syndrome and does not directly correlate with the development of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having heart-hand syndrome type 3 does not necessarily mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."
Dependence on nocturnal oxygen therapy,46273422,False,"No, dependence on nocturnal oxygen therapy is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may require supplemental oxygen therapy, dependence on nocturnal oxygen therapy can be seen in a variety of other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, interstitial lung disease, and other respiratory disorders. Therefore, having a dependence on nocturnal oxygen therapy does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Genitopalatocardiac syndrome,36674400,False,"No, the condition ""Genitopalatocardiac syndrome"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. This is because there is no known association or documented link between the two conditions in medical literature. Genitopalatocardiac syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities in the genitalia, palate, and heart, while Pulmonary Hypertension is a distinct medical condition involving elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, having Genitopalatocardiac syndrome does not necessarily mean that an individual will also have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Disorder of capillaries,321876,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of capillaries"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, it is not specifically characterized by a disorder of capillaries. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily related to elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, rather than the capillaries. Therefore, having a disorder of capillaries does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Partial defect of atrioventricular canal,37399403,False,"No

Rationale: A partial defect of atrioventricular canal is a congenital heart defect that involves abnormalities in the structure of the heart, specifically the atrial and ventricular septa, as well as the mitral and tricuspid valves. While this condition can lead to various cardiac issues, it is not specifically associated with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is more commonly linked to conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having a partial defect of atrioventricular canal does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Cyst of male tunica albuginea testis,45757419,False,"No, a cyst of the male tunica albuginea testis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. A cyst of the male tunica albuginea testis is a benign fluid-filled sac that forms on the tunica albuginea, which is the fibrous covering of the testis. This condition is typically asymptomatic and does not directly relate to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. While it is possible for a person to have both conditions simultaneously, the presence of a testicular cyst does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Overlap syndrome,4079978,False,"No, the condition ""Overlap syndrome"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Overlap syndrome refers to the coexistence of features of two or more connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or myositis. While patients with connective tissue diseases may be at an increased risk for developing Pulmonary Hypertension, having an overlap syndrome does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension in a patient with an overlap syndrome."
Rheumatic heart disease,319825,False,"No.

Rheumatic heart disease is a condition that results from rheumatic fever, which is caused by untreated streptococcal infections. It primarily affects the heart valves, leading to damage and dysfunction. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with various conditions, including connective tissue diseases, it is not specifically linked to rheumatic heart disease. Therefore, having rheumatic heart disease does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
"Heart defect, tongue hamartoma, polysyndactyly syndrome",37204832,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described (heart defect, tongue hamartoma, polysyndactyly syndrome) does not specifically point to Pulmonary Hypertension. While some heart defects can be associated with PH, the presence of tongue hamartoma and polysyndactyly are not typically seen in patients with PH. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congenital malformation,4079975,False,"No, a congenital malformation is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While congenital heart defects can be a risk factor for developing PH, not all individuals with congenital malformations will develop PH. PH can also be caused by other factors such as connective tissue diseases, chronic lung diseases, or idiopathic reasons. Therefore, having a congenital malformation does not definitively mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Heart defect and limb shortening syndrome,36715369,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Heart defect and limb shortening syndrome"" does not specifically indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While some heart defects may lead to PH as a complication, the presence of this specific condition does not definitively mean that an individual has PH. PH can be caused by various etiologies, as mentioned in the description, and the presence of a heart defect and limb shortening syndrome alone is not enough to diagnose PH. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to confirm the presence of PH in a patient with this condition."
Heart-hand syndrome type 2,36715370,False,"No, Heart-hand syndrome type 2 is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Heart-hand syndrome type 2, also known as Holt-Oram syndrome, is a genetic disorder characterized by heart defects and limb abnormalities. While individuals with Holt-Oram syndrome may have heart abnormalities that could potentially lead to pulmonary hypertension, the presence of this condition alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is a separate and distinct condition that requires specific diagnostic criteria for confirmation."
Disorder of artery,321887,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of artery"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, it is a specific condition that involves the pulmonary arteries. A general ""Disorder of artery"" could refer to a wide range of conditions affecting various arteries in the body, not specifically the pulmonary arteries as seen in Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congestive heart failure,319835,False,"No

Rationale: While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will develop congestive heart failure. Congestive heart failure can have various causes, including pulmonary hypertension, but it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having congestive heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic lumbar spinal stenosis,4002137,False,"No.

Rationale: Idiopathic lumbar spinal stenosis is a condition characterized by narrowing of the spinal canal in the lower back, leading to compression of the spinal cord and nerves. This condition primarily affects the lumbar region of the spine and is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may potentially have idiopathic lumbar spinal stenosis as a comorbidity, the presence of idiopathic lumbar spinal stenosis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiocranial syndrome Pfeiffer type,36717401,False,"No, cardiocranial syndrome Pfeiffer type is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Cardiocranial syndrome Pfeiffer type is a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniosynostosis (premature fusion of skull bones), midface hypoplasia, and broad thumbs and toes. While individuals with this syndrome may have cardiac abnormalities, it is not a defining feature of the condition and does not necessarily indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is a separate medical condition with specific diagnostic criteria related to elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature."
Congenital cardiomegaly,4170062,False,"No, congenital cardiomegaly is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Congenital cardiomegaly refers to an enlarged heart that is present at birth, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as genetic abnormalities, infections, or structural heart defects. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of congenital cardiomegaly are specifically related to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having congenital cardiomegaly does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic fluid retention,4125002,False,"No, idiopathic fluid retention is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic fluid retention refers to the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the body without a known cause. While fluid retention can be a symptom of pulmonary hypertension due to right heart failure, it is not specific to this condition. There are many other potential causes of fluid retention, such as heart failure, kidney disease, liver disease, and certain medications. Therefore, having idiopathic fluid retention does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Perirectal cellulitis,4321588,False,"No, perirectal cellulitis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Perirectal cellulitis is an infection of the skin and tissues surrounding the rectum, typically caused by bacteria entering through small cuts or tears in the skin. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may potentially develop perirectal cellulitis as a secondary infection, having perirectal cellulitis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
CK syndrome,36676440,False,"No, CK syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. CK syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, and microcephaly. There is no known association between CK syndrome and Pulmonary Hypertension based on current medical knowledge."
Pericarditis secondary to Mulibrey nanism,4149568,False,"No.

Rationale:
Pericarditis secondary to Mulibrey nanism is a specific condition related to a rare genetic disorder called Mulibrey nanism. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac-like membrane surrounding the heart. While pericarditis can be a complication of various conditions, it is not a specific symptom or characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having pericarditis secondary to Mulibrey nanism does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."

High output heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to meet the body's demands despite having a normal or elevated cardiac output. It can be caused by various factors such as anemia, hyperthyroidism, arteriovenous shunts, or chronic liver disease. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, not all cases of high output heart failure are directly related to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having high output heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Primary idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy,4274635,True,"Yes, primary idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a type of heart muscle disease where the heart chambers become stiff and less compliant, leading to impaired filling and reduced cardiac output. Primary idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy refers to cases where the cause of the condition is unknown. In the context of pulmonary hypertension, the right ventricle of the heart can become enlarged and dysfunctional due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. This can lead to right heart failure, which is a common complication of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has primary idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy, they may definitely have pulmonary hypertension as well."
Idiopathic eosinophilia,4153777,False,"No, idiopathic eosinophilia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic eosinophilia refers to an increase in eosinophils in the blood without a known cause. While eosinophilia can be seen in various conditions, including pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to this particular malady.

Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism is a condition characterized by low levels of parathyroid hormone, leading to low calcium levels in the blood. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbid conditions, idiopathic hypoparathyroidism is not a known associated condition with pulmonary hypertension."
Low output heart failure due to and following Fontan operation,3656094,True,"Yes, the condition of low output heart failure due to and following Fontan operation is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Patients who have undergone a Fontan operation, a surgical procedure used to treat certain types of congenital heart defects, are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension as a complication. The Fontan operation redirects blood flow directly to the pulmonary arteries, bypassing the right ventricle, which can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature over time. This can result in right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, which are characteristic features of Pulmonary Hypertension.

Therefore, if a patient has the condition of low output heart failure due to and following Fontan operation, they are likely to have developed Pulmonary Hypertension as a result of the surgical procedure."
Chronic hypercapnia,4325865,True,"Yes, chronic hypercapnia can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Chronic hypercapnia, which is defined as an elevated level of carbon dioxide in the blood over a prolonged period of time, can be a consequence of advanced Pulmonary Hypertension. In PH, the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure can lead to impaired gas exchange in the lungs, resulting in decreased oxygen levels and increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This can manifest as chronic hypercapnia in patients with severe PH. Therefore, if a patient has chronic hypercapnia, it may indicate the presence of advanced Pulmonary Hypertension."

Systolic heart failure stage C,43020421,True,"Yes, systolic heart failure stage C is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Systolic heart failure stage C refers to patients with structural heart disease and current or prior symptoms of heart failure. Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, which aligns with the definition of systolic heart failure stage C. Additionally, patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may present with signs of right heart failure, which is a characteristic of systolic heart failure stage C. Therefore, if a patient has systolic heart failure stage C, they may or may not have Pulmonary Hypertension, but if they have Pulmonary Hypertension, they would likely have systolic heart failure stage C."
Hemolytic anemia with emphysema AND cutis laxa,4246105,False,"No

Rationale: Hemolytic anemia with emphysema and cutis laxa are not specific conditions that are typically associated with pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have underlying conditions such as connective tissue diseases or chronic lung diseases, the presence of hemolytic anemia with emphysema and cutis laxa does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in this case."
Idiopathic erosion of teeth,4102678,False,"No, idiopathic erosion of teeth is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic erosion of teeth refers to the wearing away of tooth enamel without a known cause. This condition is typically related to factors such as diet, oral hygiene, acid reflux, or bruxism (teeth grinding), rather than being directly linked to pulmonary hypertension. While dental issues can be associated with certain systemic diseases, there is no direct correlation between idiopathic erosion of teeth and pulmonary hypertension based on current medical knowledge."
Idiopathic rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,40482881,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is a condition affecting the kidneys, specifically the glomeruli, which are the filtering units of the kidneys. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as it primarily involves kidney dysfunction rather than the pulmonary vasculature or right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have comorbidities such as kidney disease, the presence of idiopathic rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic benign cutaneous mucinosis,4033041,False,"No.

Rationale:
Idiopathic benign cutaneous mucinosis is a rare skin condition characterized by the accumulation of mucin in the skin, leading to the development of papules or nodules. This condition is primarily a dermatological issue and is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have various associated conditions, idiopathic benign cutaneous mucinosis is not a specific symptom or sign of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic benign cutaneous mucinosis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiac insufficiency as a complication of care,4153875,False,"No, cardiac insufficiency as a complication of care is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, cardiac insufficiency as a complication of care can be caused by a variety of factors unrelated to Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having cardiac insufficiency as a complication of care does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Pericardial effusion - noninflammatory,4108814,False,"No, pericardial effusion - noninflammatory is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Pericardial effusion is the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. While it can be a complication of Pulmonary Hypertension, it is not a specific condition that definitively indicates the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pericardial effusion can have various causes, including infections, malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and other cardiac conditions. Therefore, the presence of pericardial effusion alone does not necessarily mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic tests and evaluation would be needed to determine if Pulmonary Hypertension is present in a patient with pericardial effusion."
Cardiorenal syndrome,40482857,False,"No

Rationale: Cardiorenal syndrome is a condition characterized by the simultaneous dysfunction of both the heart and kidneys, leading to a complex interplay between the two organ systems. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, it is not specifically linked to renal dysfunction. Therefore, having cardiorenal syndrome does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Failure of growth of fetal right cardiac ventricle,43020509,False,"No, the condition ""Failure of growth of fetal right cardiac ventricle"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction, the specific condition mentioned does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. It is important to consider other factors and diagnostic criteria to confirm the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension in a patient."
Left ventricular abnormality,442982,False,"No

Rationale: A left ventricular abnormality is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension primarily affects the right side of the heart, left ventricular abnormalities are more commonly associated with conditions such as left heart failure, myocardial infarction, or valvular heart disease. While left heart disease can lead to pulmonary hypertension, the presence of a left ventricular abnormality alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,4270625,False,"No, primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While both conditions can lead to heart failure, they are distinct entities with different underlying pathophysiology. Primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, particularly the left ventricle, leading to impaired cardiac function. In contrast, pulmonary hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the presence of primary idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic congenital megacolon,4147792,False,"No.

Rationale:
Idiopathic congenital megacolon, also known as Hirschsprung's disease, is a condition characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, leading to functional obstruction and severe constipation. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have underlying conditions such as congenital heart defects, chronic lung diseases, or connective tissue diseases, idiopathic congenital megacolon is not typically associated with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic congenital megacolon does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary capillaritis,45768905,False,"No, pulmonary capillaritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary capillaritis is a rare condition characterized by inflammation of the capillaries in the lungs, leading to symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis (coughing up blood). While pulmonary capillaritis can be associated with connective tissue diseases, it is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having pulmonary capillaritis does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Autosomal dominant hereditary disorder,4006473,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary Hypertension can be associated with various etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases. While there is a heritable form of pulmonary hypertension, it is not specifically an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder. Therefore, having an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Mitral insufficiency and aortic stenosis,320115,False,"No

Rationale: Mitral insufficiency and aortic stenosis are conditions related to heart valve abnormalities, which can lead to various symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. While these conditions can contribute to the development of heart failure, they are not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have underlying heart valve abnormalities, the presence of mitral insufficiency and aortic stenosis alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Familial idiopathic hypercalciuria,4035146,False,"No, familial idiopathic hypercalciuria is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial idiopathic hypercalciuria is a genetic condition characterized by excessive calcium excretion in the urine, which can lead to kidney stones and other renal issues. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as fatigue or chest pain, familial idiopathic hypercalciuria is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having familial idiopathic hypercalciuria does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Heart failure with normal ejection fraction,40486933,False,"No

Rationale: Heart failure with normal ejection fraction is a condition characterized by symptoms of heart failure, such as dyspnea and fatigue, in the presence of a normal ejection fraction on echocardiography. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may ultimately develop right heart failure, the specific condition of heart failure with normal ejection fraction is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. There are various causes of heart failure with normal ejection fraction, including hypertension, diabetes, and valvular heart disease, which are not necessarily related to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having heart failure with normal ejection fraction does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis due to tuberous sclerosis syndrome,45768902,True,"Yes, the condition of Lymphangioleiomyomatosis due to tuberous sclerosis syndrome is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease that can occur in individuals with tuberous sclerosis syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that causes noncancerous tumors to form in many organs, including the lungs. LAM can lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension as a complication of the disease. Therefore, if a patient has LAM due to tuberous sclerosis syndrome, they are at risk of developing pulmonary hypertension as a result of their underlying condition."
Idiopathic hypochromic anemia,4098627,False,"No, idiopathic hypochromic anemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hypochromic anemia is a type of anemia characterized by low levels of hemoglobin and small, pale red blood cells of unknown cause. While anemia can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension due to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Therefore, having idiopathic hypochromic anemia does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic exfoliative cheilitis,45768747,False,"No, idiopathic exfoliative cheilitis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic exfoliative cheilitis is a chronic condition characterized by continuous peeling of the lips, often with unknown cause. It is considered a benign condition and is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension, which is a serious cardiovascular disease affecting the pulmonary vasculature and right heart function. While both conditions can cause discomfort and affect quality of life, they are distinct entities with different underlying pathophysiology and treatment approaches."
Developmental hereditary disorder,4180651,False,"No, the condition of a developmental hereditary disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can be hereditary in some cases, not all cases of Pulmonary Hypertension are due to a developmental hereditary disorder. There are various other causes of Pulmonary Hypertension, as mentioned in the description, such as idiopathic, drug-induced, or associated with other conditions like connective tissue diseases or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having a developmental hereditary disorder does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic portal hypertension,36716711,False,"No, idiopathic portal hypertension is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic portal hypertension is a condition characterized by increased pressure in the portal vein system, leading to complications such as variceal bleeding, ascites, and splenomegaly. It is a separate condition from pulmonary hypertension, which specifically involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. While both conditions involve increased pressure in blood vessels, they affect different vascular systems and have distinct etiologies and clinical presentations. Therefore, having idiopathic portal hypertension does not necessarily mean that an individual also has pulmonary hypertension."
Hypertrophy of septomarginal trabeculation,4235995,False,"No, hypertrophy of septomarginal trabeculation is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Hypertrophy of septomarginal trabeculation refers to an anatomical variation in the heart where there is an increase in the size of a specific muscular structure within the right ventricle. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While individuals with Pulmonary Hypertension may have hypertrophy of septomarginal trabeculation as a coincidental finding on imaging studies, the presence of this condition alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Dependence on continuous supplemental oxygen,46270565,True,"Yes, dependence on continuous supplemental oxygen can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop severe hypoxemia due to impaired gas exchange in the lungs, leading to the need for continuous supplemental oxygen therapy. This is often seen in advanced stages of the disease when there is significant impairment in pulmonary function and right heart failure. Therefore, if a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension is dependent on continuous supplemental oxygen, it is highly likely that they have the malady. However, not all patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may require continuous supplemental oxygen, as the severity of the disease can vary."
Acquired cardiac septal defect,4108950,False,"No

Rationale: An acquired cardiac septal defect is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and potentially heart failure, an acquired cardiac septal defect refers to a hole in the septum (wall) between the heart chambers, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, trauma, or previous heart surgery. While pulmonary hypertension can be a complication of certain types of congenital heart defects, it is not a defining characteristic of an acquired cardiac septal defect."
"Intellectual disability, congenital heart disease, blepharophimosis, blepharoptosis and hypoplastic teeth",4133527,False,"No

Rationale: The condition described (intellectual disability, congenital heart disease, blepharophimosis, blepharoptosis, and hypoplastic teeth) does not specifically point to Pulmonary Hypertension. While some of these features may be seen in patients with certain genetic syndromes or conditions that can also be associated with Pulmonary Hypertension, they are not specific enough to definitively diagnose Pulmonary Hypertension. A thorough clinical assessment, including echocardiography and right heart catheterization, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation not Brugada type,37109917,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation not Brugada type is a condition characterized by sudden, rapid, and chaotic heartbeats originating in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles), leading to loss of consciousness and sudden cardiac death. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation is a separate cardiac arrhythmia disorder. Therefore, having idiopathic ventricular fibrillation not Brugada type does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Congenital abnormality of cardiac vein,40487108,False,"No, a congenital abnormality of the cardiac vein is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While congenital heart defects can be associated with PH, a specific congenital abnormality of the cardiac vein does not directly correlate with the development of PH. PH can be caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, congenital heart defects. Therefore, having a congenital abnormality of the cardiac vein does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Haddad syndrome,36714655,False,"No, Haddad syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Haddad syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the combination of Hirschsprung disease (a condition where the large intestine lacks nerve cells) and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (a condition where affected individuals fail to breathe adequately in response to low oxygen levels or high carbon dioxide levels). While individuals with Haddad syndrome may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their respiratory issues, not all individuals with Haddad syndrome will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having Haddad syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute cor pulmonale due to septic pulmonary embolism,608954,True,"Yes, the condition of Acute cor pulmonale due to septic pulmonary embolism is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Acute cor pulmonale refers to right heart failure resulting from acute pulmonary hypertension, which can be caused by conditions such as pulmonary embolism. In this case, the specific cause of the acute cor pulmonale is septic pulmonary embolism, which can lead to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and subsequent right ventricular dysfunction. This aligns with the definition of Pulmonary Hypertension as a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately, heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has Acute cor pulmonale due to septic pulmonary embolism, they definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Isolated idiopathic granuloma of stomach,4078219,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Isolated idiopathic granuloma of stomach"" is not specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is a condition affecting the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricle of the heart, whereas an isolated granuloma in the stomach is a localized inflammatory response in the stomach. These two conditions are not directly related, and having an isolated granuloma in the stomach does not necessarily mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Rupture of pulmonary vessel,4221695,False,"No, the condition ""Rupture of pulmonary vessel"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, a rupture of a pulmonary vessel is a separate event that can occur due to various causes such as trauma, pulmonary embolism, or underlying vascular abnormalities. While a rupture of a pulmonary vessel could potentially lead to complications such as pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic or specific indicator of the condition."
Stricture of pulmonary vessel,4035327,False,"No, a stricture of a pulmonary vessel is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While a stricture of a pulmonary vessel could potentially contribute to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, it is not a defining characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest, as assessed by right heart catheterization. Therefore, the presence of a stricture of a pulmonary vessel alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Extreme obesity with alveolar hypoventilation,4100857,True,"Yes, extreme obesity with alveolar hypoventilation is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Extreme obesity with alveolar hypoventilation, also known as obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), is a condition characterized by the combination of obesity and chronic hypoventilation during sleep, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the blood. OHS is a known risk factor for the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. The chronic hypoventilation in OHS can lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased pulmonary vascular resistance, ultimately contributing to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient presents with extreme obesity and alveolar hypoventilation, they are at high risk for developing Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic hyperprolactinemia,4129528,False,"No.

Rationale: Idiopathic hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of the hormone prolactin in the blood, often without an identifiable cause. While idiopathic hyperprolactinemia may be present in some individuals with pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to the malady. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, which are not directly related to hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, having idiopathic hyperprolactinemia does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Primary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy,4203149,True,"Yes, primary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Primary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition characterized by dilation and impaired contraction of the left ventricle of the heart, leading to heart failure. Pulmonary hypertension can develop as a consequence of left heart failure, known as Group 2 pulmonary hypertension. In this case, if a patient has primary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of the heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has primary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, they definitely have the potential to develop pulmonary hypertension."
Disorder of peritoneum,197324,False,"No, a disorder of the peritoneum is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. The peritoneum is the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and covers the abdominal organs. Disorders of the peritoneum typically involve inflammation, infection, or other issues related to this specific anatomical structure. These conditions are not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which primarily involves the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having a disorder of the peritoneum does not necessarily mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute right-sided congestive heart failure,4215446,True,"Yes, acute right-sided congestive heart failure is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Acute right-sided congestive heart failure is a condition that can result from pulmonary hypertension. In pulmonary hypertension, elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has acute right-sided congestive heart failure, it is highly likely that they have pulmonary hypertension as the underlying cause."
Erythroderma of unknown etiology,4270742,False,"No, erythroderma of unknown etiology is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Erythroderma is a generalized redness of the skin that can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, including drug reactions, infections, inflammatory skin diseases, and malignancies. While pulmonary hypertension can present with symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, erythroderma is not a specific symptom or sign of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having erythroderma of unknown etiology does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic megacolon,4057830,False,"No, idiopathic megacolon is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic megacolon refers to a condition characterized by chronic constipation and enlargement of the colon without an identifiable cause. While chronic constipation can be a symptom of pulmonary hypertension due to decreased cardiac output and right heart failure, idiopathic megacolon is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic megacolon does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Tortuosity of pulmonary artery,40487093,False,"No, tortuosity of the pulmonary artery is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While tortuosity of the pulmonary artery may be seen in some cases of Pulmonary Hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, as assessed by right heart catheterization. Therefore, the presence of tortuosity of the pulmonary artery alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome,4086499,False,"No

Rationale: Central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome is a condition characterized by a decrease in the drive to breathe, leading to inadequate ventilation of the alveoli and subsequent hypoxemia and hypercapnia. While this condition can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication due to chronic hypoxemia, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can have various causes, as mentioned in the description, and central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension."
Hypoperfusion of right pulmonary artery due to preferential flow to left pulmonary artery,40487095,False,"No, the condition of hypoperfusion of the right pulmonary artery due to preferential flow to the left pulmonary artery is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, the specific condition described here is related to blood flow distribution within the pulmonary arteries rather than elevated pressure. This condition may be seen in other situations such as congenital heart defects or pulmonary artery stenosis, which are not necessarily indicative of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypoperfusion of left pulmonary artery due to preferential flow to right pulmonary artery,40487094,False,"No, the condition ""Hypoperfusion of left pulmonary artery due to preferential flow to right pulmonary artery"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to changes in blood flow within the pulmonary vasculature, the specific condition described does not directly correlate with the definition or pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, not by preferential flow to one side of the pulmonary artery. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Measurement finding,4041436,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Measurement finding"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is diagnosed based on specific criteria such as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest, as assessed by right heart catheterization, along with clinical symptoms and other diagnostic tests. Simply having a measurement finding without the appropriate context and criteria does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Fibromatosis,37109980,False,"No

Rationale: Fibromatosis, also known as desmoid tumors, is a rare condition characterized by the growth of noncancerous but aggressive fibrous tissue in various parts of the body. While fibromatosis can occur in different locations, it is not specifically associated with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having fibromatosis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic hilar fibrosis,4262577,False,"No, idiopathic hilar fibrosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hilar fibrosis is a rare interstitial lung disease characterized by fibrosis around the hilar region of the lung. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with various lung diseases, including interstitial lung diseases, idiopathic hilar fibrosis is not a defining or specific feature of pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions may coexist in some cases, but having idiopathic hilar fibrosis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Dextrocardia,4100815,False,"No, dextrocardia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Dextrocardia is a rare congenital condition where the heart is located on the right side of the chest instead of the left. While dextrocardia can be associated with other congenital heart defects, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having dextrocardia does not necessarily mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Soft tissue lesion,4344497,False,"No, a soft tissue lesion is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. A soft tissue lesion refers to an abnormal growth or mass in the soft tissues of the body, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as trauma, infection, inflammation, or neoplastic processes. While a soft tissue lesion may be present in a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension as a separate medical issue, it is not a defining characteristic or specific indicator of Pulmonary Hypertension. The diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily based on hemodynamic criteria and clinical symptoms related to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and right heart dysfunction."
Idiopathic nodular glomerulosclerosis,606973,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic nodular glomerulosclerosis is a kidney condition characterized by nodular lesions in the glomeruli of the kidneys. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension and does not directly correlate with the pathophysiology or symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have comorbidities such as kidney disease, the presence of idiopathic nodular glomerulosclerosis alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Venous occlusion,4145867,False,"No

Rationale: Venous occlusion is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While venous occlusion can potentially lead to increased pulmonary arterial pressure, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is specifically characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, not necessarily due to venous occlusion. Therefore, having venous occlusion does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic pyuria,606975,False,"No, idiopathic pyuria is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic pyuria refers to the presence of white blood cells in the urine without an identifiable cause. While it can be a sign of an underlying infection or inflammation in the urinary tract, it is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily a cardiovascular condition affecting the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricle of the heart, and does not typically present with urinary symptoms such as pyuria."
Idiopathic postprandial hypoglycemia,4033222,False,"No, idiopathic postprandial hypoglycemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic postprandial hypoglycemia refers to low blood sugar levels that occur after eating, with no known underlying cause. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience symptoms such as fatigue, chest pain, and syncope, these symptoms are not typically associated with idiopathic postprandial hypoglycemia. Therefore, having idiopathic postprandial hypoglycemia does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Neonatal cardiac failure due to decreased left ventricular output,36716748,False,"No, neonatal cardiac failure due to decreased left ventricular output is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, neonatal cardiac failure due to decreased left ventricular output is more indicative of issues with the left side of the heart rather than the pulmonary vasculature. This condition may be caused by various other factors such as congenital heart defects or other cardiac abnormalities. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that one has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic gastric stasis,4227773,False,"No, idiopathic gastric stasis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic gastric stasis refers to delayed emptying of the stomach without an identifiable cause, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, and early satiety. While these symptoms can be present in patients with pulmonary hypertension due to right heart failure, they are not specific to the condition. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, which are not directly related to gastric stasis. Therefore, having idiopathic gastric stasis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiac insufficiency following cardiac surgery,4264636,True,"Yes, cardiac insufficiency following cardiac surgery could be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Cardiac insufficiency following cardiac surgery can lead to right ventricular dysfunction, which is a common complication of pulmonary hypertension. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has cardiac insufficiency following cardiac surgery, it is possible that they may also have developed pulmonary hypertension as a result of the surgery. It is important to further evaluate the patient with diagnostic tests such as echocardiography and right heart catheterization to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension in this scenario."
Bifid apex of heart,40481128,False,"No, the condition ""Bifid apex of heart"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. A bifid apex of the heart refers to a rare congenital anomaly where the apex of the heart is split into two distinct points. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While a bifid apex of the heart may be present in some individuals with Pulmonary Hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic or specific indicator of the disease."
Lung finding,4115260,False,"No, the condition ""Lung finding"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. A ""Lung finding"" is a very broad term that could encompass a wide range of abnormalities or conditions related to the lungs, such as infections, tumors, or inflammatory diseases. While Pulmonary Hypertension can be associated with certain lung diseases, it is not specific to a general ""Lung finding."" Further evaluation and testing would be needed to determine if a specific lung finding is related to Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic female infertility,606977,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic female infertility is a condition related to difficulties in conceiving without a known cause. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with various conditions such as connective tissue diseases or congenital heart defects, there is no direct link between idiopathic female infertility and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic female infertility does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Systolic heart failure stage B,43530642,False,"No.

Rationale:
Systolic heart failure stage B is a condition characterized by structural heart abnormalities (such as left ventricular hypertrophy or dilation) without signs or symptoms of heart failure. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, not all patients with systolic heart failure stage B will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having systolic heart failure stage B does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Diastolic heart failure stage B,43530643,False,"No

Rationale: Diastolic heart failure stage B is a condition characterized by abnormalities in diastolic function of the heart, leading to impaired relaxation and filling of the ventricles. While diastolic heart failure can lead to elevated pulmonary pressures and right ventricular dysfunction, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Diastolic heart failure can have various underlying causes, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease, among others. Therefore, having diastolic heart failure stage B does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Finding of pulmonary arterial pressure,4115239,True,"Yes, the condition of ""Finding of pulmonary arterial pressure"" is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. In the description of Pulmonary Hypertension provided, it is stated that the condition is defined as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest, as assessed by right heart catheterization. Therefore, if a patient has a finding of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, it is indicative of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Gastritis cystica profunda,46270959,False,"No, gastritis cystica profunda is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Gastritis cystica profunda is a rare condition characterized by the presence of cystic glands within the gastric mucosa, which can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Therefore, having gastritis cystica profunda does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."

Rationale: Polysyndactyly and cardiac malformation syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the presence of extra fingers and/or toes (polysyndactyly) along with congenital heart defects. While this syndrome may be associated with other medical conditions, it is not specifically linked to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having polysyndactyly and cardiac malformation syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic intracranial hypotension,45773195,False,"No, idiopathic intracranial hypotension is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic intracranial hypotension is a condition characterized by low cerebrospinal fluid pressure within the skull, leading to symptoms such as headache, neck pain, and visual disturbances. It is not directly related to the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature seen in pulmonary hypertension. While both conditions can present with symptoms related to headache and fatigue, they are distinct entities with different underlying pathophysiology."
Idiopathic generalized osteoporosis,4004622,False,"No, idiopathic generalized osteoporosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic generalized osteoporosis is a condition characterized by decreased bone density and increased risk of fractures, while pulmonary hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. These two conditions affect different systems in the body and are not directly related to each other."
Cyst of male periurethral tissue,764733,False,"No, a cyst of male periurethral tissue is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. A cyst of male periurethral tissue refers to a fluid-filled sac or pocket that forms near the urethra in males. This condition is typically benign and may not be related to Pulmonary Hypertension, which is a complex cardiovascular condition involving elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. While both conditions can occur in the same individual, the presence of a cyst of male periurethral tissue does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation,4119302,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation is a separate condition from pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation is a rare abnormal connection between an artery and a vein in the lungs, which can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, cyanosis, and stroke. While pulmonary arteriovenous malformation can lead to complications such as pulmonary hypertension, not all patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having pulmonary arteriovenous malformation does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Hyperplasia of Brunner glands of duodenum,4342652,False,"No, hyperplasia of Brunner glands of the duodenum is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Hyperplasia of Brunner glands of the duodenum refers to an increase in the number and size of the Brunner glands, which are located in the duodenum and secrete mucus to protect the mucosa. This condition is typically benign and can be associated with various factors such as chronic gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, or certain medications. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having hyperplasia of Brunner glands of the duodenum does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic pure sudomotor failure,36716915,False,"No, idiopathic pure sudomotor failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic pure sudomotor failure is a rare condition characterized by dysfunction of the sweat glands, leading to symptoms such as anhidrosis (lack of sweating) and heat intolerance. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience symptoms such as fatigue and dyspnea, they would not typically present with symptoms specific to idiopathic pure sudomotor failure."
Hypohidrosis of unknown etiology,36716916,False,"No, hypohidrosis of unknown etiology is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Hypohidrosis refers to decreased sweating, which is not a common symptom or characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. While some conditions associated with pulmonary hypertension may have hypohidrosis as a symptom, it is not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having hypohidrosis of unknown etiology does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Structural disorder of heart,4027255,False,"No, a structural disorder of the heart is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all structural heart disorders are indicative of Pulmonary Hypertension. Structural heart disorders can encompass a wide range of conditions affecting the heart's valves, chambers, or vessels, which may or may not be related to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Therefore, the presence of a structural heart disorder does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Dilated peripartum cardiomyopathy,4037495,True,"Yes, Dilated peripartum cardiomyopathy is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Dilated peripartum cardiomyopathy is a condition characterized by the development of heart failure due to weakened heart muscle in the final month of pregnancy or within five months after giving birth. This condition can lead to right ventricular dysfunction, which is also a characteristic feature of Pulmonary Hypertension. Additionally, both conditions can result in symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and signs of right heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has Dilated peripartum cardiomyopathy, they may also have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congenital anomaly of cardiac chamber,35615056,False,"No, a congenital anomaly of a cardiac chamber is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While congenital heart defects can be associated with PH, not all cases of PH are due to congenital anomalies of cardiac chambers. PH can have various etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, chronic lung diseases, and more. Therefore, having a congenital anomaly of a cardiac chamber does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Saddle embolus of pulmonary artery with acute cor pulmonale,35615055,True,"Yes, the condition ""Saddle embolus of pulmonary artery with acute cor pulmonale"" is specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension. 

The condition describes a specific event of a large embolus blocking the main pulmonary artery, leading to acute cor pulmonale (right heart failure). This event directly causes an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest, which is a defining characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has a saddle embolus of the pulmonary artery with acute cor pulmonale, they definitely have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic osteoarthritis,4035439,False,"No, idiopathic osteoarthritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion in the affected joint. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have comorbid conditions such as osteoarthritis, the presence of idiopathic osteoarthritis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic chronic pancreatitis,4340496,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic chronic pancreatitis is a condition affecting the pancreas, characterized by inflammation and scarring of the pancreas over time. While chronic pancreatitis can lead to complications such as diabetes, malabsorption, and pancreatic cancer, it is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. These two conditions involve different organ systems and pathophysiological processes, so having idiopathic chronic pancreatitis does not necessarily mean that a person will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic pyrophosphate arthritis,4035435,False,"No.

Rationale: Idiopathic pyrophosphate arthritis is a condition characterized by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension and does not directly correlate with the pathophysiology or symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may also have idiopathic pyrophosphate arthritis, the presence of idiopathic pyrophosphate arthritis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Atrial septal defect,4289309,True,"Yes, an atrial septal defect (ASD) can be specific to pulmonary hypertension (PH). An ASD is a congenital heart defect where there is an abnormal opening in the wall between the two upper chambers of the heart (atria). This can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension over time. In the context of PH, if a patient has an ASD, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of the increased blood flow to the lungs. Therefore, if a patient has an ASD, they may definitely have pulmonary hypertension."
Stromal corneal hemorrhage,4317980,False,"No

Rationale: Stromal corneal hemorrhage is a condition involving bleeding within the cornea of the eye, which is unrelated to the pulmonary vasculature or right heart dysfunction characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. While stromal corneal hemorrhage may be a sign of an underlying systemic condition, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Interstitial lung disease due to connective tissue disease,46272927,True,"Yes, the condition ""Interstitial lung disease due to connective tissue disease"" is specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Connective tissue diseases, such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis, are known to be associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension. Interstitial lung disease is a common manifestation of connective tissue diseases and can lead to pulmonary hypertension due to chronic inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs. Therefore, if a patient has interstitial lung disease due to a connective tissue disease, they are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension. On the other hand, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have interstitial lung disease due to a connective tissue disease, as there are various other etiologies for the development of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis,36716883,False,"No, idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of granulomas in the liver of unknown cause. While it is important to consider all possible underlying conditions in a patient with pulmonary hypertension, idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis is not a known associated condition with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Congestive heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction,4139864,False,"No

Rationale: While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, congestive heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction specifically refers to heart failure caused by impaired function of the left ventricle. While pulmonary hypertension can be a complication of left heart failure, not all cases of pulmonary hypertension are directly caused by left ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having congestive heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Dilatation of common atrioventricular valve annulus,4102994,False,"No, dilatation of the common atrioventricular valve annulus is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While it may be seen in some patients with PH as a result of right heart dysfunction and dilation, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. PH is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction. Dilatation of the common atrioventricular valve annulus is more commonly associated with congenital heart defects or other cardiac conditions."
Acute myocardial infarction of right ventricle,3654465,False,"No

Rationale: While an acute myocardial infarction of the right ventricle can lead to right ventricular dysfunction, ultimately resulting in heart failure, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which is not directly caused by an acute myocardial infarction of the right ventricle. Therefore, having an acute myocardial infarction of the right ventricle does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Complex congenital heart defect,764796,True,"Yes, a complex congenital heart defect can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Patients with complex congenital heart defects are at an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension due to the chronic increase in pressure and volume overload on the right side of the heart. This can lead to pulmonary vascular remodeling and ultimately pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has a complex congenital heart defect, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of their underlying condition."
Idiopathic dilation of ureter,4127556,False,"No. Idiopathic dilation of the ureter is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic dilation of the ureter refers to an abnormal widening of the ureter without a known cause. This condition is typically related to urinary tract issues and is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbidities or conditions, idiopathic dilation of the ureter is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension."
Thomas syndrome,37396800,False,"No, Thomas syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Thomas syndrome is not a recognized medical condition or diagnosis in the medical literature. Therefore, it cannot be definitively linked to Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure,40481043,False,"No

Rationale: Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure is a specific condition related to heart failure, specifically involving impaired relaxation of the heart muscle leading to elevated pressures in the left side of the heart. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, it is not specific to acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. Pulmonary hypertension can have various etiologies and is not solely related to diastolic heart failure. Therefore, having pulmonary hypertension does not definitively mean that a person has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure."
Acute diastolic heart failure,40481042,False,"No.

Rationale:
Acute diastolic heart failure is a condition characterized by the inability of the heart to fill properly during the diastolic phase, leading to symptoms of heart failure. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of acute diastolic heart failure are specifically caused by pulmonary hypertension. There are various other causes of acute diastolic heart failure, such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, and ischemic heart disease. Therefore, having acute diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Secondary idiopathic telangiectasia,4033346,False,"No.

Rationale:
Secondary idiopathic telangiectasia is a condition characterized by the presence of small, dilated blood vessels near the surface of the skin or mucous membranes. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension and can be seen in various other conditions such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), liver disease, or as a side effect of certain medications. While pulmonary hypertension can present with symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain, the presence of secondary idiopathic telangiectasia alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in a patient with secondary idiopathic telangiectasia."
Autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia due to G6PC3 deficiency,37204406,False,"No

Rationale: Autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia due to G6PC3 deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system, specifically causing a decrease in neutrophils. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as it does not directly involve the pulmonary vasculature or right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with severe congenital neutropenia may have other medical conditions, there is no direct link between this specific condition and pulmonary hypertension."
Acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure,36716978,True,"Yes, acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension can develop acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure due to the progression of the disease leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory muscle weakness. This condition can be a complication of Pulmonary Hypertension, indicating a severe and advanced stage of the disease. Therefore, if a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension presents with acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, it is highly likely that they have the malady."
Acyanotic congenital heart disease,4301767,False,"No, acyanotic congenital heart disease is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Acyanotic congenital heart disease refers to a group of heart defects present at birth that do not cause cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels). While some types of congenital heart disease can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all cases of acyanotic congenital heart disease will result in pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having acyanotic congenital heart disease does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
Fetal heart failure due to extracardiac disease,45766964,False,"No. Fetal heart failure due to extracardiac disease is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, fetal heart failure due to extracardiac disease refers to heart failure in a fetus caused by conditions outside of the heart. These conditions could include issues with the placenta, umbilical cord, or other organs affecting the heart's ability to function properly. Therefore, having fetal heart failure due to extracardiac disease does not definitively mean that the individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Red half-moon nail in congestive heart failure,4293582,False,"No

Rationale: The presence of a red half-moon nail, also known as Terry's nails, is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While it can be seen in various medical conditions, including congestive heart failure, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having a red half-moon nail in congestive heart failure does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."

Therefore, having idiopathic atrophy of the nail in childhood does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Congenital hypoplasia of heart,4246484,False,"No, congenital hypoplasia of the heart is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Congenital hypoplasia of the heart refers to underdevelopment of the heart structures, which can lead to various congenital heart defects. While congenital heart defects can contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension, not all individuals with congenital hypoplasia of the heart will develop pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can have various causes, as mentioned in the description, and congenital heart defects are just one of the potential contributing factors. Therefore, having congenital hypoplasia of the heart does not definitively mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."
Corneal flap macrostriae,4187046,False,"No

Rationale: Corneal flap macrostriae is a condition related to complications following LASIK surgery, which affects the cornea of the eye. It is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as it does not have a direct relationship with the cardiovascular system or the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, having corneal flap macrostriae does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Congenital absence of heart structure,4187043,False,"No, congenital absence of heart structure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While congenital heart defects can be associated with PH, the absence of a heart structure would not directly lead to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. Pulmonary Hypertension is more commonly associated with conditions such as connective tissue diseases, chronic lung diseases, or congenital heart defects that result in increased pulmonary arterial pressure. Therefore, the presence of congenital absence of a heart structure does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic idiopathic anhidrosis,4045725,False,"No, chronic idiopathic anhidrosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic idiopathic anhidrosis refers to the inability to sweat normally without an identifiable cause. While it may be seen in some patients with pulmonary hypertension due to autonomic dysfunction, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having chronic idiopathic anhidrosis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Connective tissue hereditary disorder,4176799,True,"Yes, a connective tissue hereditary disorder can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Connective tissue disorders, such as systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) or Marfan syndrome, are known risk factors for the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. In these conditions, the abnormal connective tissue can affect the blood vessels in the lungs, leading to increased pulmonary arterial pressure and the development of PH. Therefore, if a patient has a connective tissue hereditary disorder, they may be at higher risk for developing Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic anaphylaxis,4084639,False,"No, idiopathic anaphylaxis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic anaphylaxis refers to a severe allergic reaction with no identifiable trigger, leading to symptoms such as hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, and potentially anaphylactic shock. While both conditions can present with respiratory symptoms, they are distinct entities with different underlying mechanisms and diagnostic criteria. Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right heart dysfunction, whereas idiopathic anaphylaxis is an acute allergic reaction. Therefore, having idiopathic anaphylaxis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Congenital anomaly of thorax,4176798,False,"No

Rationale: A congenital anomaly of the thorax is a structural abnormality present at birth affecting the chest area. While it may be associated with certain conditions that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension itself. Pulmonary hypertension can be caused by a variety of factors, including congenital heart defects, but the presence of a congenital anomaly of the thorax does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic diffuse hyperhidrosis,4045726,False,"No, idiopathic diffuse hyperhidrosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic diffuse hyperhidrosis refers to excessive sweating without a known cause, which is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension.

Therefore, having idiopathic diffuse hyperhidrosis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Obstructed pulmonary venous connection,4101018,False,"No, obstructed pulmonary venous connection is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While obstructed pulmonary venous connection can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all cases of pulmonary hypertension are caused by obstructed pulmonary venous connection. Pulmonary hypertension can have various etiologies, as mentioned in the description, and obstructed pulmonary venous connection is just one of the potential causes. Therefore, having obstructed pulmonary venous connection does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congenital anomaly of cardiovascular structure of trunk,4176794,False,"No, the condition ""Congenital anomaly of cardiovascular structure of trunk"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While congenital heart defects can be associated with PH, not all cases of PH are due to congenital anomalies of the cardiovascular structure of the trunk. PH can have various etiologies, as mentioned in the description, and can be associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, chronic lung diseases, or idiopathic causes. Therefore, having a congenital anomaly of the cardiovascular structure of the trunk does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Pleuropericardial cyst,4113304,False,"No, a pleuropericardial cyst is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

A pleuropericardial cyst is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by a fluid-filled sac located between the pericardium and pleura. It is typically asymptomatic and incidentally discovered on imaging studies. While it may cause symptoms such as chest pain or dyspnea if it becomes large enough to compress surrounding structures, it is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction, which is not directly influenced by the presence of a pleuropericardial cyst. Therefore, having a pleuropericardial cyst does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic short stature,36712855,False,"No, idiopathic short stature is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic short stature refers to a condition in which a child is significantly shorter than average for their age and sex, but no specific cause can be identified. It is a separate condition from pulmonary hypertension, which is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may also have idiopathic short stature, the presence of idiopathic short stature does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Exacerbation of heart failure,1340348,False,"No

Rationale: An exacerbation of heart failure is a condition that can occur in patients with pulmonary hypertension, but it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Patients with pulmonary hypertension can develop right heart failure as a complication of the disease, but exacerbation of heart failure can also occur in patients with other underlying cardiac conditions such as coronary artery disease or valvular heart disease. Therefore, while an exacerbation of heart failure can be seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to this malady."
Solitary pulmonary trunk with aortic atresia,4101014,True,"Yes, the condition of solitary pulmonary trunk with aortic atresia is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Solitary pulmonary trunk with aortic atresia is a congenital heart defect that can lead to increased pulmonary arterial pressure, which is a key feature of Pulmonary Hypertension. In this case, the condition directly leads to the malady, making it a specific indicator of Pulmonary Hypertension."

While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbidities or conditions, idiopathic hydronephrosis is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension."
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to heart valve disease,45773075,False,"No, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to heart valve disease is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While both conditions can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, they have different underlying causes. Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, whereas heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to heart valve disease is caused by dysfunction of the heart valves leading to impaired pumping of blood. Therefore, having heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to heart valve disease does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic urethral stricture,762785,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic urethral stricture is a narrowing of the urethra without a known cause. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as there is no direct relationship between the two. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily related to elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, which is not directly influenced by the presence of an idiopathic urethral stricture."
Familial fibrous mediastinitis,4119439,False,"No.

Rationale: Familial fibrous mediastinitis is a rare condition characterized by the development of fibrous tissue in the mediastinum, which can lead to compression of nearby structures such as the heart, great vessels, and airways. This condition is not specifically associated with pulmonary hypertension. While it may cause symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and other respiratory symptoms, it is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having familial fibrous mediastinitis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic systolic heart failure,40479192,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic systolic heart failure is a condition characterized by the inability of the heart to pump effectively, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention.

Therefore, having chronic systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic pulmonary thromboembolism without pulmonary hypertension,45771016,False,"No, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism without pulmonary hypertension is not specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Chronic pulmonary thromboembolism refers to the presence of blood clots in the pulmonary arteries over a prolonged period of time. While chronic pulmonary thromboembolism can lead to pulmonary hypertension in some cases, it is not a definitive indicator of the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which can have various underlying causes beyond chronic pulmonary thromboembolism. Therefore, having chronic pulmonary thromboembolism without pulmonary hypertension does not necessarily mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation, such as right heart catheterization, would be needed to confirm the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension in this case."
Legal abortion complicated by cardiac failure,605117,False,"No

Rationale: While a legal abortion complicated by cardiac failure can lead to heart-related issues, it does not specifically indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a specific condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately, heart failure. A legal abortion complicated by cardiac failure may have various causes, and pulmonary hypertension is just one of many potential underlying conditions. Therefore, having a legal abortion complicated by cardiac failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Sprain,3171204,False,"No, a sprain is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. A sprain is an injury to a ligament caused by the overstretching or tearing of the ligament.

While pulmonary complications can occur in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome is not a defining feature of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,318397,False,"No, chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic ITP is a condition characterized by a low platelet count due to immune-mediated destruction of platelets. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have thrombocytopenia as a result of their condition, not all patients with chronic ITP will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having chronic ITP does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Acute on chronic heart failure co-occurrent with normal ejection fraction,764874,False,"No, the condition ""Acute on chronic heart failure co-occurrent with normal ejection fraction"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, the specific condition described does not necessarily indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Acute on chronic heart failure with normal ejection fraction can have various causes, including coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, or other cardiomyopathies. It is important to consider a comprehensive evaluation, including imaging studies and laboratory tests, to determine the underlying cause of heart failure in this case."
Calcification of pulmonary valve annulus,43020625,False,"No, calcification of the pulmonary valve annulus is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While calcification of the pulmonary valve annulus may be seen in patients with PH, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, the presence of calcification of the pulmonary valve annulus alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of PH."
Reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute heart failure,764873,False,"No.

The condition of reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, reduced ejection fraction due to acute heart failure can have various other causes as well, such as myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, or valvular heart disease. Therefore, having reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to chronic heart failure,764872,True,"Yes, the condition of reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to chronic heart failure is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. In patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction can occur as a result of the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, leading to heart failure. Reduced ejection fraction is a common finding in patients with heart failure, including those with Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has the condition of reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to chronic heart failure, they definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute heart failure co-occurrent with normal ejection fraction,764877,False,"No, acute heart failure co-occurrent with normal ejection fraction is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right heart failure as a result of elevated pulmonary pressures, acute heart failure with normal ejection fraction can have various causes, including coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, myocarditis, or other conditions. Therefore, the presence of acute heart failure with normal ejection fraction does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the acute heart failure in this case."
Chronic heart failure co-occurrent with normal ejection fraction,764876,False,"No, chronic heart failure co-occurrent with normal ejection fraction is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right heart failure as a result of elevated pulmonary pressures, chronic heart failure with normal ejection fraction can have various other causes such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathies. Therefore, the presence of chronic heart failure with normal ejection fraction does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to confirm the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension in this case."
Illegal abortion complicated by cardiac failure,605120,True,"Yes, the condition of illegal abortion complicated by cardiac failure is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

In the description of Pulmonary Hypertension, it is mentioned that the condition can result from various etiologies, including drug-induced causes. An illegal abortion can involve the use of medications or procedures that can lead to cardiac complications, ultimately resulting in elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. This can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which are characteristic features of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if someone has a history of an illegal abortion complicated by cardiac failure, it is highly likely that they have developed Pulmonary Hypertension as a result."
Heart failure confirmed,4215689,True,"Yes, if a person has confirmed heart failure, they may definitely have pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, so the presence of heart failure could indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the description of pulmonary hypertension mentions that it can result in signs of right heart failure. Therefore, the condition of heart failure confirmed is specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension."
Reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute on chronic heart failure,764871,True,"Yes, the condition of reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute on chronic heart failure is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, which can manifest as reduced ejection fraction. Acute on chronic heart failure can exacerbate the symptoms of Pulmonary Hypertension, leading to a worsening of the condition. Therefore, if a patient has the condition of reduced ejection fraction co-occurrent and due to acute on chronic heart failure, they definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congestive heart failure stage B due to ischemic cardiomyopathy,36712928,False,"No, congestive heart failure stage B due to ischemic cardiomyopathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of heart failure, even if due to ischemic cardiomyopathy, will result in pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, there are various causes of heart failure, and not all cases will be associated with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having congestive heart failure stage B due to ischemic cardiomyopathy does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Systolic heart failure stage C due to ischemic cardiomyopathy,36712929,True,"Yes, the condition of systolic heart failure stage C due to ischemic cardiomyopathy is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, especially in advanced stages such as stage C heart failure, are at increased risk for developing pulmonary hypertension. The elevated pulmonary pressures in pulmonary hypertension can be a consequence of the right ventricular dysfunction that occurs in the setting of heart failure. Additionally, the increased pulmonary pressures can further exacerbate the heart failure by causing right ventricular strain and worsening symptoms. 

Therefore, if a patient has systolic heart failure stage C due to ischemic cardiomyopathy, they are likely to also have pulmonary hypertension as a result of their underlying heart condition."
Neoplasm of connective tissues,373718,False,"No

Rationale: A neoplasm of connective tissues is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with connective tissue diseases, the presence of a neoplasm of connective tissues does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional evaluation and diagnostic testing would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in a patient with a neoplasm of connective tissues."
Failed attempted termination of pregnancy with amniotic fluid embolism,4017134,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary Hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately, heart failure. While amniotic fluid embolism can lead to acute respiratory distress and cardiovascular collapse, it is not a specific condition that would definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is typically diagnosed through specific hemodynamic and pathophysiological criteria, as mentioned in the description provided. Therefore, the presence of a failed attempted termination of pregnancy with amniotic fluid embolism does not necessarily mean that the individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."

Connective tissue diseases, such as systemic sclerosis or systemic lupus erythematosus, are known to be associated with the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. In these cases, the connective tissue disorder can lead to changes in the pulmonary vasculature, ultimately resulting in elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and the development of PH. Therefore, if a patient has a disorder of connective tissue co-occurrent and due to a systemic disease, they may definitely have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Vascular ring with malrotation and dextroversion of heart and hypoplasia of right lung and left arterial duct,40489394,False,"No, the condition ""Vascular ring with malrotation and dextroversion of heart and hypoplasia of right lung and left arterial duct"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While this condition involves abnormalities in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, it does not directly correlate with the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature that defines Pulmonary Hypertension. The presence of this condition may indicate other underlying issues, but it does not definitively point to Pulmonary Hypertension."
Periureteritis,4056032,False,"No, periureteritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Periureteritis refers to inflammation of the tissue surrounding the ureter, which is not a known symptom or characteristic of pulmonary hypertension.

Therefore, if a patient has heart failure due to end stage congenital heart disease, they may also have pulmonary hypertension as a result of their underlying heart condition."
Ayerza's syndrome,4193236,True,"Yes

Rationale:
Ayerza's syndrome, also known as Eisenmenger syndrome, is a specific condition that can lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension. It is a complication of certain congenital heart defects, such as ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, or patent ductus arteriosus, where there is a reversal of blood flow within the heart leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and ultimately pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has Ayerza's syndrome, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension as it is a direct consequence of the underlying heart defect."
Idiopathic methemoglobinemia,4103123,False,"No, idiopathic methemoglobinemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic methemoglobinemia is a rare condition characterized by the presence of an abnormal form of hemoglobin in the blood, which reduces the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While both conditions can result in symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath, they are distinct entities with different underlying mechanisms."
Complication,433128,False,"No, the condition ""Complication"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Complications can arise from various medical conditions, including Pulmonary Hypertension, but having a complication does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension. Complications can be a result of a wide range of diseases and conditions, so it is not specific to any one particular malady."
Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease,257004,False,"No, an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD will have pulmonary hypertension.

While angiomatosis can occur in the lungs and potentially contribute to pulmonary hypertension in some cases, it is not a defining or specific feature of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which is not directly related to the presence of angiomas in other organs. Therefore, having angiomatosis does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Electrocardiogram abnormal,320536,False,"No, an electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While patients with PH may have ECG abnormalities such as right ventricular hypertrophy or strain pattern, these findings are not exclusive to PH and can be seen in other cardiac conditions as well. Therefore, having an abnormal ECG does not definitively mean that a person has PH. Additional diagnostic tests such as echocardiography and right heart catheterization are needed to confirm the diagnosis of PH."
Pulmonary trunk abnormality,4109343,False,"No, a pulmonary trunk abnormality is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While certain abnormalities in the pulmonary trunk may contribute to the development of PH, not all individuals with a pulmonary trunk abnormality will develop PH. Pulmonary trunk abnormalities can be congenital or acquired and may present with a variety of symptoms and complications, but they do not definitively indicate the presence of PH. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to determine if PH is present in a patient with a pulmonary trunk abnormality."
Localization-related idiopathic epilepsy,4150299,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary Hypertension is a cardiovascular condition related to elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, while Localization-related idiopathic epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures. These two conditions are not directly related, and having one does not necessarily mean you have the other."
Idiopathic colitis,4230258,False,"No. Idiopathic colitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the colon of unknown cause. While it is possible for a patient with pulmonary hypertension to also have idiopathic colitis, the presence of idiopathic colitis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions are not directly related, and the presence of one does not necessarily mean the presence of the other."
Arterial duct dependent pulmonary circulation,43021994,True,"Yes, the condition ""Arterial duct dependent pulmonary circulation"" is specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Arterial duct dependent pulmonary circulation refers to a condition where the ductus arteriosus, a blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta in fetal circulation, remains open after birth. This can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension. In this case, if a patient has arterial duct dependent pulmonary circulation, they definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Postpartum cardiomyopathy,312383,True,"Yes, postpartum cardiomyopathy is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Postpartum cardiomyopathy is a condition characterized by the development of heart failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery, in the absence of any other identifiable cause. Pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, which aligns with the pathophysiology of postpartum cardiomyopathy. Therefore, if a patient has postpartum cardiomyopathy, they may also have pulmonary hypertension as a result of the right ventricular dysfunction."
Hiatal hernia,4224004,False,"No, a hiatal hernia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

A hiatal hernia is a condition where part of the stomach protrudes through the diaphragm into the chest cavity.

Idiopathic orofacial dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions in the face, jaw, or tongue, leading to abnormal movements or postures. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, and having idiopathic orofacial dystonia does not necessarily mean that a person also has pulmonary hypertension."
Cryptogenic sexual precocity,4097301,False,"No, cryptogenic sexual precocity is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Cryptogenic sexual precocity refers to the early onset of puberty of unknown cause, which is unrelated to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, and is not associated with early puberty. Therefore, having cryptogenic sexual precocity does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Old myocardial infarction,314666,False,"No

Rationale: An old myocardial infarction is a past event of heart muscle damage due to lack of blood flow to the heart. While it may lead to heart failure, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily related to elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately, heart failure. Therefore, having an old myocardial infarction does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Sonoda syndrome,37396245,False,"No, Sonoda syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Sonoda syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) associated with pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary vascular disease, and Eisenmenger syndrome. While Sonoda syndrome can be a complication of Pulmonary Hypertension, not all patients with Pulmonary Hypertension will develop Sonoda syndrome. Therefore, having Sonoda syndrome does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic Cushing's syndrome,4099340,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic Cushing's syndrome is a condition characterized by excessive cortisol production by the adrenal glands, leading to a variety of symptoms such as weight gain, muscle weakness, fatigue, and high blood pressure. While Cushing's syndrome can have various systemic effects, it is not specifically associated with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic Cushing's syndrome does not definitively mean that a person will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Pleural effusion due to congestive heart failure,4236658,True,"Yes, pleural effusion due to congestive heart failure is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Pleural effusion is a common finding in patients with congestive heart failure, which can lead to elevated pulmonary pressures and ultimately result in pulmonary hypertension. In this case, if a patient has pleural effusion due to congestive heart failure, it is highly likely that they also have pulmonary hypertension as a result of the underlying heart condition. Therefore, the presence of pleural effusion due to congestive heart failure is specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension."
Acute systolic heart failure,40480603,False,"No, acute systolic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, acute systolic heart failure can have various causes, including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, and more. Therefore, having acute systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary vein finding,4119821,False,"No, a pulmonary vein finding is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary vein findings may indicate other conditions such as pulmonary vein stenosis, pulmonary vein thrombosis, or pulmonary vein obstruction, which are not necessarily indicative of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, not necessarily related to pulmonary vein abnormalities."
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure,40480602,False,"No

Rationale: Acute on chronic systolic heart failure is a condition characterized by a sudden worsening of symptoms in a patient with pre-existing heart failure, specifically related to reduced ejection fraction. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have acute on chronic systolic heart failure. Therefore, having acute on chronic systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a patient has pulmonary hypertension."
Injury of connective tissue,4300157,False,"No, injury of connective tissue is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While connective tissue diseases can be associated with PH, an injury of connective tissue alone does not definitively indicate the presence of PH. PH can be caused by various etiologies, including connective tissue diseases, but an injury of connective tissue may not necessarily lead to the development of PH. Additional diagnostic evaluation and assessment would be needed to determine if a patient with an injury of connective tissue also has PH."
Hadziselimovic syndrome,36714252,False,"No, Hadziselimovic syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Hadziselimovic syndrome, also known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), is a genetic disorder that affects the structure and function of cilia in the respiratory tract, leading to recurrent respiratory infections, sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. While respiratory symptoms can overlap with those seen in Pulmonary Hypertension, Hadziselimovic syndrome is a distinct condition with a different underlying etiology and pathophysiology. Therefore, having Hadziselimovic syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual also has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Respiratory failure without hypercapnia,4119934,False,"No

Rationale: Respiratory failure without hypercapnia is a condition where the lungs are unable to adequately oxygenate the blood, leading to low oxygen levels in the body. While respiratory failure can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension, it is not a specific condition that definitively indicates the presence of pulmonary hypertension. There are many other potential causes of respiratory failure without hypercapnia, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the presence of respiratory failure without hypercapnia does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Sleep disorder,435524,False,"No, a sleep disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While sleep disturbances can be a symptom of Pulmonary Hypertension, they are not exclusive to this condition. Sleep disorders can be caused by a variety of factors such as stress, lifestyle habits, underlying medical conditions, or other sleep disorders. Therefore, having a sleep disorder does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Ulcer of tunica vaginalis,4093308,False,"No, an ulcer of the tunica vaginalis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. An ulcer of the tunica vaginalis refers to a lesion or sore on the tunica vaginalis, which is the inner layer of the membrane surrounding the testis. This condition is typically associated with trauma, infection, or other local factors. It is not a known symptom or complication of pulmonary hypertension."
Radiation-induced fibrous mediastinitis,4119926,False,"No

Rationale: Radiation-induced fibrous mediastinitis is a condition characterized by fibrosis and scarring of the mediastinum due to previous radiation therapy. While this condition may lead to compression of the pulmonary vasculature and potentially contribute to pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can have various causes, and while radiation-induced fibrous mediastinitis may be a contributing factor in some cases, it is not a definitive indicator of the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in a patient with radiation-induced fibrous mediastinitis."
Infectious fibrous mediastinitis,4119925,False,"No

Rationale: Infectious fibrous mediastinitis is a condition characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the mediastinum, which is the space in the chest between the lungs. While infectious fibrous mediastinitis can lead to complications such as compression of nearby structures and difficulty breathing, it is not specifically associated with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily related to elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having infectious fibrous mediastinitis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic cyst of iris,435542,False,"No, the condition ""Idiopathic cyst of iris"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Idiopathic cyst of iris refers to a benign cyst or lesion on the iris of the eye, which is unrelated to the pulmonary vasculature or heart function. While it is important to consider all aspects of a patient's health, the presence of an idiopathic cyst of iris does not necessarily indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
"Cataract, congenital heart disease, neural tube defect syndrome",37111650,False,"No, the condition ""Cataract, congenital heart disease, neural tube defect syndrome"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
The condition listed includes a combination of cataract (an eye condition), congenital heart disease, and neural tube defect syndrome. These conditions are not typically associated with or specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While some congenital heart defects may be associated with PH, the presence of cataracts and neural tube defects does not directly correlate with the development of PH. Therefore, having the condition does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Dilated cardiomyopathy with connective tissue disorder,4185450,True,"Yes, the condition of Dilated cardiomyopathy with connective tissue disorder is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Connective tissue disorders, such as systemic sclerosis, are known to be associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension. In patients with connective tissue disorders, there is an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension due to the underlying inflammatory and fibrotic processes affecting the pulmonary vasculature. Additionally, dilated cardiomyopathy can lead to right ventricular dysfunction, which is a common complication of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has dilated cardiomyopathy with a connective tissue disorder, they are at an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension."
Cutis laxa secondary to inherited disorder of connective tissue,4298007,True,"Yes, cutis laxa secondary to an inherited disorder of connective tissue can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. In some cases, cutis laxa can be associated with certain genetic conditions such as Williams syndrome, which can also present with pulmonary hypertension as a complication. Therefore, if a patient has cutis laxa secondary to an inherited disorder of connective tissue, they may definitely have pulmonary hypertension as well."
Interstitial myocarditis,4242712,False,"No, interstitial myocarditis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Interstitial myocarditis is an inflammatory condition affecting the myocardium, or the heart muscle, which can be caused by various factors such as viral infections, autoimmune diseases, or toxic exposures. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, interstitial myocarditis is a separate condition that can present with symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and arrhythmias. Therefore, having interstitial myocarditis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension, as the two conditions have different etiologies and pathophysiology."
Collagen disease,255334,True,"Yes, the condition of collagen disease is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. Collagen diseases, also known as connective tissue diseases, are a known risk factor for the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. Conditions such as systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis are examples of collagen diseases that can be associated with the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has a collagen disease, they may develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a complication of their underlying condition."
Faciocardiorenal syndrome,37109595,False,"No, the condition ""Faciocardiorenal syndrome"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Faciocardiorenal syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism, congenital heart defects, and renal anomalies. While some patients with this syndrome may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of their congenital heart defects, not all individuals with faciocardiorenal syndrome will develop PH. Therefore, having faciocardiorenal syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."
Primary cardiomyopathy,4232495,False,"No

Rationale: Primary cardiomyopathy is a condition that specifically refers to diseases of the heart muscle itself, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or restrictive cardiomyopathy. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, primary cardiomyopathy is not a specific condition that is always present in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having primary cardiomyopathy does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic capillaritis,4033870,False,"No, idiopathic capillaritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic capillaritis refers to inflammation of the capillaries of unknown cause, typically presenting as red or purple spots on the skin. While skin manifestations can occur in some cases of pulmonary hypertension, idiopathic capillaritis is not a defining or specific feature of the condition. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, rather than skin inflammation."
Idiopathic livedo reticularis,4033867,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic livedo reticularis is a benign skin condition characterized by a mottled, net-like pattern on the skin due to blood vessel abnormalities. It is not specific to pulmonary hypertension and does not directly correlate with the pathophysiology or symptoms of the disease. While some patients with pulmonary hypertension may have skin manifestations, idiopathic livedo reticularis is not a defining or specific condition for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension."
Primary idiopathic cutaneous telangiectasia,4033863,False,"No, primary idiopathic cutaneous telangiectasia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Primary idiopathic cutaneous telangiectasia refers to small dilated blood vessels near the surface of the skin, typically on the face, neck, or chest. While it may be associated with certain underlying conditions such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, it is not a known symptom or sign of pulmonary hypertension. In the context of the description provided, there is no direct link between primary idiopathic cutaneous telangiectasia and pulmonary hypertension."
Deposition of fat on visceral pericardium,37312324,False,"No. 

The deposition of fat on the visceral pericardium is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop right heart failure, which can lead to pericardial effusion (accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac), the deposition of fat on the visceral pericardium is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. It may be seen in conditions such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, or pericardial diseases, but it is not a specific indicator of pulmonary hypertension."
Hypertensive heart and renal disease with both (congestive) heart failure and renal failure,439694,False,"No.

Rationale:
The condition described, hypertensive heart and renal disease with both (congestive) heart failure and renal failure, is a specific condition involving both the heart and kidneys due to hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, it is a distinct condition primarily affecting the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, having hypertensive heart and renal disease with both heart failure and renal failure does not necessarily mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a separate diagnosis that requires specific hemodynamic criteria and evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature."
Hypertensive heart and renal disease with renal failure,439695,False,"No.

The condition ""Hypertensive heart and renal disease with renal failure"" refers to a specific condition involving both the heart and kidneys, with renal failure being a key component. While hypertension can be a risk factor for developing pulmonary hypertension, the presence of renal failure in this condition does not necessarily indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which is not directly related to the heart and renal disease with renal failure described in the condition provided. Therefore, the presence of ""Hypertensive heart and renal disease with renal failure"" does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Right heart failure secondary to left heart failure,4195785,False,"No, right heart failure secondary to left heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While right heart failure can be a complication of Pulmonary Hypertension due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction, it can also occur as a result of left heart failure. In the case of right heart failure secondary to left heart failure, the primary issue is dysfunction of the left side of the heart leading to fluid backup into the lungs and eventually affecting the right side of the heart. Therefore, this condition is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia,4318674,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a condition characterized by the destruction of red blood cells by the immune system. While this condition may be present in some patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to the malady. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, rather than destruction of red blood cells. Therefore, having chronic idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Meacham syndrome,36716451,False,"No, Meacham syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Meacham syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, cataracts, and distinctive facial features. It is not known to be directly associated with Pulmonary Hypertension based on current medical knowledge."
Benign hypertensive heart disease with congestive cardiac failure,439698,False,"No, the condition ""Benign hypertensive heart disease with congestive cardiac failure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately, heart failure. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop congestive heart failure as a result of right ventricular dysfunction, the condition ""Benign hypertensive heart disease with congestive cardiac failure"" does not specifically indicate the presence of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, which is a key feature of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Therefore, having ""Benign hypertensive heart disease with congestive cardiac failure"" does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypertensive heart and renal disease with (congestive) heart failure,439696,False,"No

Rationale: While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, the specific condition of ""Hypertensive heart and renal disease with (congestive) heart failure"" does not necessarily indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. This condition refers to heart and kidney disease resulting from high blood pressure, which can lead to heart failure. It does not specifically mention the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having this condition does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Acute respiratory distress,4191650,False,"No, acute respiratory distress is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Acute respiratory distress is a serious condition characterized by sudden and severe difficulty in breathing, which can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While pulmonary hypertension can lead to symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, acute respiratory distress is a more general term that can be caused by a wide range of conditions beyond pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having acute respiratory distress does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Finding of region of thorax,4185503,False,"No, the condition ""Finding of region of thorax"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. This condition is a general finding that could indicate a variety of issues within the thoracic region, such as musculoskeletal problems, respiratory conditions, or even cardiac issues. It does not directly correlate with the specific pathophysiological state of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure seen in Pulmonary Hypertension. Further evaluation and testing would be needed to determine if there is a relationship between this finding and the diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Ectopia cordis,4302306,False,"No, ectopia cordis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Ectopia cordis is a rare congenital condition where the heart is located partially or completely outside of the chest cavity. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While a patient with ectopia cordis may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication, having ectopia cordis does not definitively mean that the patient has pulmonary hypertension."
Clouding of corneal stroma,4318693,False,"No, clouding of the corneal stroma is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Clouding of the corneal stroma is a condition that affects the clarity of the cornea, which is the transparent front part of the eye. This condition can be caused by various factors such as infections, inflammation, trauma, or genetic disorders. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension, which primarily affects the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular function. Therefore, having clouding of the corneal stroma does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Cyst of rete testis,4001176,False,"No, a cyst of rete testis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. A cyst of rete testis is a benign fluid-filled sac within the rete testis, which is a network of tubules located in the mediastinum testis. This condition is typically asymptomatic and does not have a direct relationship with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a separate and distinct condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, having a cyst of rete testis does not necessarily mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Arcus lipoides corneae,4318694,False,"No, arcus lipoides corneae is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Arcus lipoides corneae is a benign condition characterized by a white or gray ring around the cornea, typically seen in older individuals. It is often associated with aging or conditions such as hyperlipidemia. While arcus lipoides corneae may be present in some patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining or specific feature of the disease. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily diagnosed based on hemodynamic criteria and clinical symptoms related to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and right heart dysfunction."
Idiopathic paroxysmal sialorrhea,44783363,False,"No, idiopathic paroxysmal sialorrhea is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic paroxysmal sialorrhea refers to excessive drooling that occurs without an identifiable cause. While pulmonary hypertension can present with symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and syncope, excessive drooling is not a typical symptom associated with this condition. Therefore, having idiopathic paroxysmal sialorrhea does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Human immunodeficiency virus infection,439727,False,"No, human immunodeficiency virus infection is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with HIV infection may develop various cardiovascular complications, including pulmonary hypertension, the presence of HIV infection does not definitively mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can have various causes, as mentioned in the description, and HIV infection is just one of many potential contributing factors. Therefore, the presence of HIV infection does not guarantee the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Disorder of pulp of tooth,4238825,False,"No, a disorder of the pulp of a tooth is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. The condition of a disorder of the pulp of a tooth refers to issues within the innermost part of the tooth, such as infection or inflammation. This is a dental condition and is not related to the complex and progressive cardiovascular condition of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Histiocytic syndrome,4130197,False,"No. Histiocytic syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Histiocytic syndrome refers to a group of rare disorders characterized by an overproduction of histiocytes, a type of white blood cell. While some patients with histiocytic syndromes may develop pulmonary involvement, such as pulmonary histiocytosis or pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, this is not a defining feature of the condition. Therefore, having histiocytic syndrome does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging of lung,437677,False,"No, abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging of the lung are not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While imaging studies such as chest X-rays or CT scans may show abnormalities in the lungs of patients with PH, these findings are not exclusive to this condition. Abnormal lung imaging can be seen in a variety of respiratory diseases, infections, tumors, and other pulmonary conditions. Therefore, the presence of abnormal findings on lung imaging alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic tests and clinical evaluation are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PH."
Chronic non-infectious enteritis of uncertain etiology,42536740,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic non-infectious enteritis of uncertain etiology is a condition involving inflammation of the small intestine of unknown cause. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as they involve different organ systems and pathophysiological processes. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may potentially have gastrointestinal symptoms, the presence of chronic non-infectious enteritis of uncertain etiology does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic calcification of skin,4033934,False,"No, idiopathic calcification of the skin is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic calcification of the skin refers to the abnormal deposition of calcium in the skin, which is not a known symptom or characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have skin changes due to chronic hypoxia or other associated conditions, idiopathic calcification of the skin is not a typical finding in this disease."
Congenital anomaly of pulmonary artery,435646,True,"Yes, a congenital anomaly of the pulmonary artery can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Congenital heart defects, including anomalies of the pulmonary artery, can lead to increased pulmonary arterial pressure and ultimately result in pulmonary hypertension. In this case, if a patient has a congenital anomaly of the pulmonary artery, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a consequence of the structural abnormality. Therefore, having a congenital anomaly of the pulmonary artery can definitely lead to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Cor triloculare,4068742,True,"Yes, cor triloculare is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Cor triloculare is a specific type of congenital heart defect where there are three atria in the heart instead of the normal two. This condition is often associated with pulmonary hypertension, as the abnormal heart structure can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, if a patient has cor triloculare, they are likely to also have pulmonary hypertension. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have cor triloculare, as there are many other potential causes of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure."
Congenital epicardial cyst,4068743,False,"No, a congenital epicardial cyst is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

A congenital epicardial cyst is a rare condition characterized by a fluid-filled sac located on the surface of the heart. It is typically asymptomatic and may be an incidental finding on imaging studies. While it is important to evaluate and monitor congenital epicardial cysts, they are not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, which are not directly influenced by the presence of a congenital epicardial cyst."
Subcutaneous fat disorder,4054401,False,"No

Rationale: Subcutaneous fat disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have changes in body composition, such as subcutaneous fat redistribution, the presence of a subcutaneous fat disorder alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction."
Idiopathic transient neonatal hyperinsulinemia,4173187,False,"No, idiopathic transient neonatal hyperinsulinemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic transient neonatal hyperinsulinemia is a condition characterized by excessive insulin production in newborns, which can lead to low blood sugar levels. This condition is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While it is possible for a newborn with idiopathic transient neonatal hyperinsulinemia to develop pulmonary hypertension later in life, the presence of the condition does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Hypertensive disorder,316866,False,"No

Rationale: A hypertensive disorder is a general term used to describe conditions characterized by high blood pressure. While pulmonary hypertension specifically refers to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, a hypertensive disorder can refer to high blood pressure in any part of the body. Therefore, having a hypertensive disorder does not necessarily mean that one has pulmonary hypertension."
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia,4101624,False,"No, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is a genetic condition that affects the heart muscle, leading to abnormal heart rhythms and potentially heart failure. While patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their heart disease, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Therefore, having arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction,4101625,True,"Yes, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, contributing to the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. This obstruction can result in right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, which are characteristic features of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, they may definitely have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Multiple congenital cardiac defects,4314504,True,"Yes, multiple congenital cardiac defects are specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Patients with multiple congenital cardiac defects, such as atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, or patent ductus arteriosus, are at increased risk for developing pulmonary hypertension. The presence of these defects can lead to increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, ultimately causing pulmonary vascular remodeling and the development of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has multiple congenital cardiac defects, they are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension."
Combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction,40482727,False,"No, combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right ventricular dysfunction, which can manifest as combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction, this condition can also be seen in other cardiac diseases such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Abnormality of mitral valve annulus,40490938,False,"No, an abnormality of the mitral valve annulus is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While certain heart conditions, such as mitral valve disease, can contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension, an abnormality of the mitral valve annulus alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional diagnostic testing and evaluation would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in a patient with an abnormality of the mitral valve annulus."
Heart valve disorder,4281749,False,"No

Rationale: A heart valve disorder is a broad term that encompasses various conditions affecting the valves of the heart, such as stenosis, regurgitation, or prolapse. While some heart valve disorders can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a secondary complication, not all individuals with a heart valve disorder will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having a heart valve disorder does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic cyst of ciliary body,443857,False,"No, the condition ""Idiopathic cyst of ciliary body"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. The presence of an idiopathic cyst of the ciliary body does not necessarily indicate or correlate with the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. These are two distinct medical conditions that affect different organ systems (eye vs. lungs and heart). Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily related to the pulmonary vasculature and right heart function, while an idiopathic cyst of the ciliary body is a localized issue within the eye. Therefore, having an idiopathic cyst of the ciliary body does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Heart failure resolved,44801905,False,"No

Rationale: The presence of heart failure resolved does not necessarily indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, the reverse is not always true. Pulmonary Hypertension can result from various etiologies, and heart failure resolved may have resolved due to other causes. Therefore, having heart failure resolved does not definitively mean that one has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congestive heart failure due to valvular disease,4142561,False,"No

Rationale: Congestive heart failure due to valvular disease is a specific condition related to heart failure caused by malfunctioning heart valves. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of heart failure due to valvular disease will result in pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having congestive heart failure due to valvular disease does not necessarily mean that a person definitely has pulmonary hypertension."
Acute pulmonary edema,261600,False,"No

Rationale: Acute pulmonary edema is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing, coughing, and potentially pink, frothy sputum. While acute pulmonary edema can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to the condition. Acute pulmonary edema can also be caused by other conditions such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, or kidney failure. Therefore, if a person has acute pulmonary edema, they may or may not have pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic osteoporosis,81390,False,"No, idiopathic osteoporosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic osteoporosis is a condition characterized by decreased bone density and increased risk of fractures without a known cause. While osteoporosis can be associated with certain medical conditions, it is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions are distinct and can occur independently of each other."
Idiopathic pulmonary arteriosclerosis,4173261,True,"Yes, idiopathic pulmonary arteriosclerosis is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Idiopathic pulmonary arteriosclerosis is a term that was previously used to describe a form of pulmonary hypertension with unknown cause. It is now classified under the broader category of pulmonary hypertension, specifically idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Since idiopathic pulmonary arteriosclerosis is a subtype of pulmonary hypertension, if a patient has this condition, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic left-sided congestive heart failure,4206009,False,"No, chronic left-sided congestive heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, chronic left-sided congestive heart failure is a separate condition that primarily affects the left side of the heart. It is characterized by the inability of the left ventricle to pump blood effectively, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and other parts of the body. While pulmonary hypertension can be a complication of chronic left-sided congestive heart failure, not all patients with chronic left-sided congestive heart failure will develop pulmonary hypertension."
Congenital pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm,4101572,True,"Yes, congenital pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Congenital pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm is a rare condition characterized by abnormal connections between pulmonary arteries and veins, leading to shunting of blood and potentially causing pulmonary hypertension. In this case, if a patient has congenital pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm, they would definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension, as this condition can contribute to the elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure and subsequent right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, the presence of congenital pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic polyarthritis,4195770,False,"No, idiopathic polyarthritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic polyarthritis refers to joint inflammation of unknown cause affecting multiple joints, while pulmonary hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right heart dysfunction.

Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorder that primarily affects the lungs. It is characterized by the formation of nodular granulomatous lesions within the lung tissue. While pulmonary hypertension is not a direct symptom of lymphomatoid granulomatosis, the presence of this condition in the lungs can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a secondary complication. The obstruction of blood flow within the pulmonary vasculature due to the granulomatous lesions can increase pulmonary arterial pressure, ultimately leading to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has lymphomatoid granulomatosis of the lung, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of the underlying condition."
Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure,46273719,False,"No

Rationale: Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by an increase in arterial carbon dioxide levels due to inadequate ventilation. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right heart failure and subsequent respiratory symptoms, acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Therefore, if a patient has connective tissue disease overlap syndrome, they may definitely have Pulmonary Hypertension as well."
Congenital malposition of heart,313011,False,"No. Congenital malposition of the heart is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While congenital heart defects can be associated with PH, not all cases of congenital malposition of the heart will lead to the development of PH. PH can have various causes, including but not limited to congenital heart defects, so the presence of congenital malposition of the heart does not definitively mean that a person has PH. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to confirm the presence of PH in a patient with congenital malposition of the heart."
Chronic idiopathic neutropenia,4095623,False,"No, chronic idiopathic neutropenia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic idiopathic neutropenia is a condition characterized by a persistent decrease in the number of neutrophils in the blood, which can lead to an increased risk of infections. While chronic idiopathic neutropenia may be present in some patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having chronic idiopathic neutropenia does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Cryptogenic cirrhosis,4232955,False,"No, cryptogenic cirrhosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Cryptogenic cirrhosis refers to cirrhosis of the liver where the cause is unknown. While there can be associations between liver disease and pulmonary hypertension, having cryptogenic cirrhosis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions may coexist in some cases, but they are not directly linked in a way that one condition always leads to the other. Additional evaluation and testing would be needed to determine if a patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis also has pulmonary hypertension."
Cyst of tunica vaginalis,607947,False,"No, a cyst of tunica vaginalis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. A cyst of tunica vaginalis is a fluid-filled sac that develops in the tunica vaginalis, which is the pouch of the peritoneum that covers the testes. This condition is typically benign and does not directly relate to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may also have a cyst of tunica vaginalis, the presence of the cyst does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Hypertensive heart failure,444101,False,"No

Rationale: While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of hypertensive heart failure are specifically due to pulmonary hypertension. Hypertensive heart failure can also be caused by other conditions such as systemic hypertension leading to left ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having hypertensive heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic environmental intolerance,45765757,False,"No, idiopathic environmental intolerance is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic environmental intolerance, also known as multiple chemical sensitivity, is a condition characterized by symptoms that are triggered by exposure to low levels of multiple chemicals or environmental factors. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction.

Therefore, having lymphadenopathy does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Endocardial cushion defect,435912,True,"Yes, endocardial cushion defect is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Endocardial cushion defect, also known as atrioventricular septal defect, is a congenital heart defect that is commonly associated with Pulmonary Hypertension. Patients with endocardial cushion defect often develop pulmonary hypertension due to the increased blood flow and pressure in the pulmonary vasculature caused by the defect. This increased pressure can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, which are characteristic features of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has endocardial cushion defect, they are likely to develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a result of the defect."
Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome,4308623,False,"No, idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by persistently elevated levels of eosinophils in the blood, which can lead to damage in multiple organs including the heart, lungs, skin, and nervous system. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with various conditions, including connective tissue diseases, it is not specifically linked to idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Therefore, having idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
Congestive heart failure with right heart failure,44782713,True,"Yes, congestive heart failure with right heart failure is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Congestive heart failure with right heart failure is a common complication of pulmonary hypertension, as the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure leads to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has congestive heart failure with right heart failure, it is highly likely that they also have pulmonary hypertension. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will necessarily have congestive heart failure with right heart failure, as the condition can present with a variety of symptoms and severity levels."
Chronic toxic interstitial nephritis,4126442,False,"No, chronic toxic interstitial nephritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic toxic interstitial nephritis refers to inflammation and damage to the interstitium of the kidneys due to exposure to toxic substances. While kidney dysfunction can contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension in some cases, the presence of chronic toxic interstitial nephritis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional diagnostic evaluation would be needed to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension in a patient with chronic toxic interstitial nephritis."
Chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure,44782719,False,"No, chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure can have various causes, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure,44782718,False,"No, acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure can have various causes, including but not limited to coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."

Rationale: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute lower respiratory infection is a specific condition that involves a combination of chronic lung disease (COPD) and an acute infection affecting the lower respiratory tract. While patients with COPD are at an increased risk for developing pulmonary hypertension due to chronic hypoxia and inflammation, having COPD with an acute lower respiratory infection does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a separate condition that requires specific diagnostic criteria, including right heart catheterization to confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, having COPD with an acute lower respiratory infection does not necessarily mean that a patient has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic retinitis,4195992,False,"No, idiopathic retinitis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic retinitis refers to inflammation of the retina of unknown cause, which is a condition affecting the eyes. While some systemic diseases can have ocular manifestations, there is no direct link between idiopathic retinitis and pulmonary hypertension based on current medical knowledge."
Pulmonary atresia with confluent pulmonary arteries,4112096,True,"Yes, pulmonary atresia with confluent pulmonary arteries is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Pulmonary atresia with confluent pulmonary arteries is a congenital heart defect where the pulmonary valve is completely closed, leading to decreased blood flow to the lungs. This can result in increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, ultimately leading to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has pulmonary atresia with confluent pulmonary arteries, they will definitely have pulmonary hypertension as a result of this underlying condition."
Cardiorespiratory failure,4259490,False,"No, cardiorespiratory failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Cardiorespiratory failure is a broad term that refers to the inability of the heart and lungs to function adequately to meet the body's metabolic demands. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right heart failure and ultimately heart failure, it is not the only cause of cardiorespiratory failure. There are many other conditions that can lead to cardiorespiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocardial infarction, severe pneumonia, and others. Therefore, having cardiorespiratory failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."

Idiopathic posterior uveitis,36676800,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic posterior uveitis is a condition involving inflammation in the back of the eye, specifically in the uvea. While it is possible for patients with pulmonary hypertension to have other conditions such as uveitis, the presence of idiopathic posterior uveitis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions are not directly related, and the presence of one does not necessarily mean the presence of the other."
Heart failure exacerbated by Sotalol,3184320,False,"No, heart failure exacerbated by Sotalol is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While heart failure can be a complication of Pulmonary Hypertension due to the right ventricular dysfunction that can occur, heart failure exacerbated by Sotalol is a specific condition related to the use of the medication Sotalol. Sotalol is a beta-blocker that can worsen heart failure in some patients, but it is not a defining characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having heart failure exacerbated by Sotalol does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."

Therefore, having chemical-induced pulmonary edema does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Coronary artery fistula to right ventricle,4187852,False,"No

Rationale: A coronary artery fistula to the right ventricle is a rare congenital anomaly where there is an abnormal connection between a coronary artery and a cardiac chamber, in this case, the right ventricle. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While it may lead to symptoms such as heart failure, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having a coronary artery fistula to the right ventricle does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,4259507,False,"No, juvenile idiopathic arthritis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While there have been reported cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients with pulmonary hypertension, the presence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory condition affecting the joints, while pulmonary hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. The two conditions are distinct entities with different pathophysiological mechanisms and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, the presence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis does not necessarily mean that a patient has pulmonary hypertension."

Atelectasis is a condition characterized by the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It can be caused by various factors such as blockage of the airways, pressure on the lung, or inadequate surfactant production. While atelectasis can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension due to decreased blood flow to the lungs, it is not a defining feature of the disease. Therefore, having atelectasis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Sepsis-associated right ventricular failure,4079296,True,"Yes, sepsis-associated right ventricular failure is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Sepsis-associated right ventricular failure can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension, as the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure in PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction. In this case, if a patient has sepsis-associated right ventricular failure, it is highly likely that they also have pulmonary hypertension. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will develop sepsis-associated right ventricular failure, as it is a specific complication that may occur in some cases but not all."
Lipoatrophy,4087489,False,"No, lipoatrophy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Lipoatrophy refers to the localized loss of fat tissue, which can be caused by various factors such as certain medications (e.g., antiretroviral drugs), autoimmune conditions, or genetic disorders. It is not a known symptom or sign of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having lipoatrophy does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic passive congestion of liver,200451,False,"No

Rationale: Chronic passive congestion of the liver is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While chronic passive congestion of the liver can be a consequence of right heart failure, which can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension, it is not a definitive indicator of the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Other conditions can also lead to chronic passive congestion of the liver, such as congestive heart failure from other causes or liver diseases. Therefore, the presence of chronic passive congestion of the liver does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Injury of pulmonary artery,435972,False,"No, an injury of the pulmonary artery is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While an injury to the pulmonary artery could potentially lead to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, there are many other possible causes of Pulmonary Hypertension as outlined in the description of the malady. Therefore, having an injury of the pulmonary artery does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congenital endocardial fibroelastosis,605954,True,"Yes, congenital endocardial fibroelastosis is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Congenital endocardial fibroelastosis is a rare condition characterized by thickening of the endocardium, which can lead to heart failure. This condition can be a cause of pulmonary hypertension, as the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, which are characteristic features of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has congenital endocardial fibroelastosis, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of the underlying heart condition."
Pulmonary artery appearance - finding,4181812,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Pulmonary artery appearance - finding"" is a radiological finding that may suggest the presence of pulmonary hypertension, but it is not specific to the malady.

This condition is localized to specific teeth in the affected region and does not have a direct association with pulmonary hypertension."
Bernheim's syndrome,4030258,False,"No, Bernheim's syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Bernheim's syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the heart, which is a small hole between the upper chambers of the heart that fails to close after birth. This condition can lead to paradoxical embolism, where a blood clot from the venous circulation crosses over to the arterial circulation through the PFO, potentially causing strokes or other complications. While patients with Bernheim's syndrome may have an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension due to the potential for emboli to travel to the lungs, the presence of Bernheim's syndrome does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional diagnostic testing would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension in a patient with Bernheim's syndrome."
Andersen Tawil syndrome,4224848,False,"No, Andersen Tawil syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Andersen Tawil syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a triad of symptoms including periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and distinctive facial features.

Erythrocytosis due to alveolar hypoventilation,4249398,True,"Yes, erythrocytosis due to alveolar hypoventilation can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Erythrocytosis, or an increase in red blood cell count, can occur as a compensatory mechanism in response to chronic hypoxia, which is a common feature of Pulmonary Hypertension. Alveolar hypoventilation can lead to decreased oxygen levels in the blood, triggering the body to produce more red blood cells in an attempt to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. This can contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension, as the increased blood viscosity from the elevated red blood cell count can further strain the pulmonary vasculature.

Therefore, if a patient presents with erythrocytosis due to alveolar hypoventilation, it may be indicative of underlying Pulmonary Hypertension. However, it is important to perform further diagnostic evaluations to confirm the presence of PH and determine the appropriate treatment plan."
Disorder of vitreous body,317299,False,"No, a disorder of the vitreous body is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. A disorder of the vitreous body refers to any condition affecting the gel-like substance that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eye. This can include conditions such as vitreous detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, or vitreous opacities. These conditions are related to the eye and do not have a direct connection to pulmonary hypertension, which primarily affects the pulmonary vasculature and heart."
Congenital anomaly of myocardium,4069190,False,"No. A congenital anomaly of the myocardium refers to structural abnormalities present in the heart muscle that are present from birth. While this condition may impact heart function and potentially lead to heart failure, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is specifically characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately, heart failure. While a congenital anomaly of the myocardium may contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition."
Hemicardia,4069191,False,"No, hemicardia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Hemicardia refers to a condition where the heart is located more towards one side of the chest rather than being centrally located. This is a structural anomaly rather than a symptom or sign of pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, hemicardia is not a direct indicator of this condition."
Idiopathic myocarditis,317307,False,"No, idiopathic myocarditis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic myocarditis refers to inflammation of the heart muscle of unknown cause, which can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and heart failure. While heart failure can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension, idiopathic myocarditis can have various causes and is not always directly related to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic myocarditis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Hereditary nephropathy,45757752,False,"No, hereditary nephropathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Hereditary nephropathy refers to a group of inherited kidney diseases that affect the structure and function of the kidneys. While there may be some overlap in terms of genetic predisposition or underlying conditions that can contribute to both hereditary nephropathy and pulmonary hypertension, having hereditary nephropathy does not definitively mean that an individual will also have pulmonary hypertension. Each condition has its own distinct pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and treatment approaches."
Generalized pruritus of unknown etiology,4296645,False,"No, generalized pruritus of unknown etiology is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pruritus, or itching, is a common symptom that can be associated with a wide range of conditions, including skin disorders, allergic reactions, liver disease, kidney disease, and certain medications. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may experience symptoms such as fatigue and chest pain, generalized pruritus is not a typical symptom associated with this condition. Therefore, the presence of generalized pruritus of unknown etiology does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Atrial fibrillation,313217,False,"No, atrial fibrillation is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While atrial fibrillation can be seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia characterized by irregular and often rapid heart rate, which can occur in various cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. In the context of pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation may be a consequence of right heart dysfunction and atrial enlargement, but it is not a necessary component for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, the presence of atrial fibrillation does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Normal insertion of arterial duct into proximal left pulmonary artery,43021592,False,"No, the condition of normal insertion of the arterial duct into the proximal left pulmonary artery is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. This condition refers to a normal anatomical variation in the positioning of the arterial duct, which is not directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which is not directly influenced by the insertion of the arterial duct. Therefore, having this specific condition does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypertension secondary to drug,4108213,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Hypertension secondary to drug"" refers to elevated blood pressure caused by certain medications. While this condition involves high blood pressure, it is not specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension specifically refers to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Therefore, having hypertension secondary to a drug does not necessarily mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Mitral valve stenosis,315273,False,"No

Rationale: Mitral valve stenosis is a condition that involves narrowing of the mitral valve in the heart, leading to impaired blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. While mitral valve stenosis can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a consequence of increased pressure in the left atrium and pulmonary veins, not all patients with mitral valve stenosis will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having mitral valve stenosis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Lupus erythematosus,255891,False,"No, Lupus erythematosus is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Lupus erythematosus may develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a complication of their disease, not all patients with Lupus erythematosus will have Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension can be caused by various etiologies, as mentioned in the description, and Lupus erythematosus is just one of the potential underlying conditions associated with PH. Therefore, having Lupus erythematosus does not definitively mean that a person will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic glomerulonephritis,45772072,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic glomerulonephritis is a condition affecting the kidneys, specifically the glomeruli, which are the filtering units of the kidneys. It is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension, which primarily affects the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular function. While patients with certain conditions such as connective tissue diseases may be at risk for both idiopathic glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hypertension, having idiopathic glomerulonephritis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Colloid milium,4298709,False,"No, colloid milium is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Colloid milium is a rare cutaneous condition characterized by the deposition of colloid material in the skin, typically presenting as yellowish papules or nodules. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which primarily involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may have other skin manifestations due to underlying conditions, colloid milium is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension."
Acute idiopathic pericarditis,315293,False,"No

Rationale: Acute idiopathic pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, which can present with symptoms such as chest pain, fever, and pericardial friction rub. While pericarditis can lead to complications such as pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop pericarditis as a complication, having acute idiopathic pericarditis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Autoimmune connective tissue disorder,4179877,True,"Yes, an autoimmune connective tissue disorder can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Many autoimmune connective tissue disorders, such as systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis, are known to be associated with pulmonary hypertension. In these conditions, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues, leading to inflammation and damage in various organs, including the lungs and blood vessels. This can result in pulmonary vascular remodeling and increased pulmonary arterial pressure, ultimately leading to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has an autoimmune connective tissue disorder, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their underlying condition."
Congestive rheumatic heart failure,315295,False,"No.

Rationale: Congestive rheumatic heart failure is a specific condition related to heart failure caused by rheumatic heart disease, which is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, congestive rheumatic heart failure specifically refers to heart failure caused by rheumatic heart disease, which is a result of rheumatic fever. Therefore, having congestive rheumatic heart failure does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Aneurysm of heart,438168,False,"No, an aneurysm of the heart is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While both conditions can lead to heart failure, they are distinct entities with different underlying pathophysiology. Aneurysm of the heart refers to a localized, abnormal dilation of a blood vessel in the heart, which can be caused by various factors such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, or previous heart attacks. On the other hand, pulmonary hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While they can both contribute to heart failure, having an aneurysm of the heart does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Congenital malposition of cardiac apex,442277,False,"No

Rationale: Congenital malposition of the cardiac apex is a structural abnormality of the heart where the apex is located in an abnormal position. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension and can occur independently of PH. While patients with congenital malposition of the cardiac apex may have other cardiac abnormalities that could potentially lead to pulmonary hypertension, the presence of this condition alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Congenital abnormality of cardiac connection,4099994,True,"Yes, a congenital abnormality of cardiac connection can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Congenital heart defects are a known cause of Pulmonary Hypertension, as mentioned in the description of the malady. These defects can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, ultimately resulting in PH. Therefore, if a patient has a congenital abnormality of cardiac connection, they may develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a result."
Atrioventricular septal defect with atrioventricular valve regurgitation,40488397,True,"Yes, the condition ""Atrioventricular septal defect with atrioventricular valve regurgitation"" is specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension.

Rationale:
Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) is a congenital heart defect that can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension over time. Additionally, atrioventricular valve regurgitation can contribute to right ventricular dysfunction, which is a common complication of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has AVSD with atrioventricular valve regurgitation, they are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension as a result of the underlying heart abnormalities."
"Coloboma, heart malformation, choanal atresia, retardation of growth and development, genital abnormalities, and ear malformations association",4165529,False,"No, the condition described (Coloboma, heart malformation, choanal atresia, retardation of growth and development, genital abnormalities, and ear malformations association) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While some of these features may be seen in certain genetic syndromes or conditions that can be associated with Pulmonary Hypertension, the presence of these features alone does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. A thorough evaluation including clinical assessment, imaging studies, and right heart catheterization would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congenital abnormality of relationship of cardiac component,4099993,False,"No, the condition ""Congenital abnormality of relationship of cardiac component"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While congenital heart defects can be associated with PH, not all cases of PH are due to congenital abnormalities of the heart. PH can have various etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having a congenital abnormality of the relationship of cardiac components does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Indian childhood cirrhosis,4268006,False,"No, Indian childhood cirrhosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Indian childhood cirrhosis is a rare form of liver disease that primarily affects children in India, leading to liver failure and cirrhosis. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as fatigue and potentially right heart failure in advanced cases, Indian childhood cirrhosis does not directly cause pulmonary hypertension. The two conditions have distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and etiologies."
Requires mechanical ventilatory assistance,3190682,False,"No

Rationale: The condition ""Requires mechanical ventilatory assistance"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with severe Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right heart failure and require ventilatory support, the need for mechanical ventilation can be due to various other conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, or neuromuscular disorders. Therefore, having the condition of requiring mechanical ventilatory assistance does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic idiopathic constipation,4306923,False,"No, chronic idiopathic constipation is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While constipation can be a symptom of various conditions, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. In the case of pulmonary hypertension, symptoms typically involve respiratory and cardiovascular issues such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and signs of right heart failure. Therefore, the presence of chronic idiopathic constipation does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic recurrent stupor,35622321,False,"No, idiopathic recurrent stupor is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic recurrent stupor refers to a condition characterized by episodes of sudden, temporary unconsciousness or altered mental status of unknown cause. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to symptoms such as fatigue and syncope, idiopathic recurrent stupor is a separate condition that may have various underlying causes unrelated to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having idiopathic recurrent stupor does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Normal insertion of arterial ligament into proximal left pulmonary artery,43021601,False,"No, the condition of normal insertion of the arterial ligament into the proximal left pulmonary artery is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. This condition refers to a normal anatomical variation and does not directly correlate with the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which is not directly related to the insertion of the arterial ligament into the pulmonary artery. Therefore, having this condition does not necessarily mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acquired abnormality of pulmonary venous structure,43021605,False,"No.

Rationale: An acquired abnormality of pulmonary venous structure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can result from various etiologies, including abnormalities in the pulmonary vasculature, the presence of an acquired abnormality of pulmonary venous structure does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Further evaluation and diagnostic testing would be necessary to determine if pulmonary hypertension is present in this case."
Cyanotic congenital heart disease,4132742,True,"Yes, cyanotic congenital heart disease is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Cyanotic congenital heart disease refers to a group of heart defects present at birth that result in low oxygen levels in the blood, leading to a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes (cyanosis). These defects can cause increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, which can ultimately lead to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has cyanotic congenital heart disease, they are at risk of developing pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their underlying heart condition. On the other hand, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have cyanotic congenital heart disease, as there are various other causes of PH as mentioned in the description of the malady."
Right ventricular thrombus,4206589,False,"No, the condition ""Right ventricular thrombus"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop complications such as right ventricular thrombus due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, having a right ventricular thrombus does not necessarily mean that the individual has Pulmonary Hypertension. Right ventricular thrombus can occur in various other conditions such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, and hypercoagulable states. Therefore, the presence of a right ventricular thrombus does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia,35622306,False,"No, idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is a rare immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a low CD4 T-cell count in the absence of HIV infection or any other known cause. While patients with idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia may present with various symptoms related to immune dysfunction, there is no direct association between this condition and Pulmonary Hypertension. The two conditions have different pathophysiological mechanisms and etiologies."
Acute heart failure,442310,False,"No

Rationale: Acute heart failure is a condition characterized by the sudden onset of symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling due to the heart's inability to pump blood effectively. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of acute heart failure are specifically caused by pulmonary hypertension. Acute heart failure can have various causes, including coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, among others. Therefore, having acute heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Acquired central alveolar hypoventilation,46269699,False,"No

Rationale: Acquired central alveolar hypoventilation is a condition where there is a decrease in the drive to breathe, leading to inadequate ventilation of the alveoli. While this condition can lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue, these symptoms are not specific to acquired central alveolar hypoventilation. Therefore, having acquired central alveolar hypoventilation does not necessarily mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary blood vessel injury,440260,True,"Yes, pulmonary blood vessel injury is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which can result from various etiologies including pulmonary blood vessel injury. In the context of PH, pulmonary blood vessel injury can contribute to the pathophysiological state of increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Therefore, if a person has pulmonary blood vessel injury, they may develop Pulmonary Hypertension as a result."
Cardiomegaly - hypertensive,4173820,False,"No

Rationale: Cardiomegaly, or an enlarged heart, can be caused by a variety of conditions, including hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of cardiomegaly due to hypertension will specifically lead to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having cardiomegaly due to hypertension does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Neurofibroma,4300676,False,"No, neurofibroma is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Neurofibroma is a benign nerve sheath tumor that arises from the cells that cover nerves. It is typically associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on nerves. While neurofibromas can occur in various parts of the body, they are not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. The presence of neurofibroma does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension, as these are two distinct medical conditions with different underlying causes and manifestations."
Dilatation of annulus of aortic valve,40492453,False,"No, dilatation of the annulus of the aortic valve is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While it may be seen in some patients with pulmonary hypertension as a result of right ventricular dysfunction and increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, right ventricular dysfunction, and symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Dilatation of the annulus of the aortic valve may be seen in other conditions such as aortic valve disease or aortic root dilatation."
Idiopathic hemochromatosis,4220813,False,"No, idiopathic hemochromatosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive absorption of dietary iron, leading to iron overload in various organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas. While iron overload can potentially lead to heart failure, it is not a direct cause of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which is not a characteristic feature of idiopathic hemochromatosis. Therefore, having idiopathic hemochromatosis does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
Disorder of blood vessels of thorax,4190192,True,"Yes, the condition ""Disorder of blood vessels of thorax"" is specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which involves the blood vessels of the thorax. Therefore, if someone has a disorder of the blood vessels of the thorax, it is likely that they have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Larsen-like syndrome B3GAT3 type,35622345,False,"No

Rationale: Larsen-like syndrome B3GAT3 type is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple joint dislocations, characteristic facial features, and other skeletal abnormalities. There is no known association between Larsen-like syndrome B3GAT3 type and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having Larsen-like syndrome B3GAT3 type does not necessarily mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter,37395937,False,"No

Rationale: Idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter is a specific condition related to abnormal heart rhythms in newborns, particularly involving the atria. While it is a concerning condition that requires medical attention, it is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While some patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop arrhythmias as a complication of their condition, idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension."
Mass of cardiovascular structure,4102113,False,"No, a mass of a cardiovascular structure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While PH is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, a mass of a cardiovascular structure could be indicative of other conditions such as tumors, thrombi, or other structural abnormalities. Further diagnostic evaluation would be needed to determine the specific cause of the mass and its relationship to Pulmonary Hypertension."
Idiopathic hirsutism,4065246,False,"No, idiopathic hirsutism is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hirsutism refers to excessive hair growth in women in a male pattern distribution without an identifiable underlying cause. While pulmonary hypertension can present with symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and syncope, excessive hair growth is not a typical symptom associated with this condition. Therefore, having idiopathic hirsutism does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Compensated cardiac failure,4108244,False,"No

Rationale: Compensated cardiac failure is a condition where the heart is able to maintain adequate function despite underlying heart disease. In the case of pulmonary hypertension, the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has compensated cardiac failure, it does not necessarily mean they have pulmonary hypertension. However, if a patient has pulmonary hypertension, they may develop right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which could present as compensated cardiac failure."
Acute left ventricular failure,4108245,False,"No, acute left ventricular failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Acute left ventricular failure refers to a sudden onset of heart failure due to the inability of the left ventricle to pump blood effectively. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, acute left ventricular failure is more commonly associated with conditions such as myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. Therefore, having acute left ventricular failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Mixed collagen vascular disease,4134867,True,"Yes, mixed collagen vascular disease can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Mixed collagen vascular disease, also known as mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by features of multiple connective tissue diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis. Patients with MCTD can develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their underlying autoimmune condition. Pulmonary hypertension can be a manifestation of the vascular involvement seen in MCTD, leading to elevated pulmonary arterial pressures and right heart dysfunction. Therefore, if a patient has mixed collagen vascular disease, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of their autoimmune condition."
Idiopathic hypotension,4112334,False,"No, idiopathic hypotension is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hypotension refers to low blood pressure of unknown cause, which is the opposite of elevated blood pressure seen in pulmonary hypertension. While both conditions involve blood pressure abnormalities, they are distinct entities with different underlying pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria. Therefore, having idiopathic hypotension does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic granulomatous interstitial nephropathy,4018127,False,"No.

Rationale: Idiopathic granulomatous interstitial nephropathy is a condition affecting the kidneys, specifically characterized by the presence of granulomas in the interstitium of the kidney. This condition is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as it primarily affects the kidneys and does not directly involve the pulmonary vasculature or right ventricular dysfunction. While a patient with pulmonary hypertension may have other comorbidities, including kidney disease, the presence of idiopathic granulomatous interstitial nephropathy does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic hypersomnia,43531627,False,"No, idiopathic hypersomnia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic hypersomnia is a neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, prolonged nighttime sleep, difficulty waking from sleep, and cognitive dysfunction. It is not directly related to the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature seen in pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience fatigue and sleep disturbances, idiopathic hypersomnia is a separate condition with its own distinct set of symptoms and diagnostic criteria."
Necrotizing vasculitis secondary to connective tissue disease,4292533,True,"Yes, the condition of necrotizing vasculitis secondary to connective tissue disease is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Necrotizing vasculitis is a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to blood vessel walls, which can lead to impaired blood flow and tissue damage. When this condition is secondary to a connective tissue disease, it can contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension. Connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and systemic lupus erythematosus are known to be associated with pulmonary hypertension, and necrotizing vasculitis can be a manifestation of these underlying conditions. Therefore, if a patient has necrotizing vasculitis secondary to a connective tissue disease, they are at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their primary condition."
Heart failure with mid range ejection fraction,37311948,False,"No, heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can ultimately lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction can have various causes, including but not limited to coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Oro-facial digital syndrome type 13,35622375,False,"No, Oro-facial digital syndrome type 13 is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Oro-facial digital syndrome type 13 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities in the development of the face, oral cavity, and digits.
