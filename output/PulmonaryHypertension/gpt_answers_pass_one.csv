Measurement finding,4041436,False,"No.

Rationale: A ""measurement finding"" is a broad term that can refer to any quantifiable data obtained from a patient, such as blood pressure, heart rate, blood test results, or imaging findings. It is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) because measurement findings can be associated with a wide range of medical conditions. For instance, elevated blood pressure can be a measurement finding in systemic hypertension, while abnormal blood gas levels can be a finding in respiratory diseases. Therefore, having a measurement finding does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypertensive disorder,316866,False,"No.

Rationale: A hypertensive disorder generally refers to conditions characterized by elevated blood pressure, such as essential hypertension, secondary hypertension, or hypertensive crisis. While pulmonary hypertension (PH) involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries, it is a specific type of hypertension that affects the lungs and the right side of the heart. 

Having a hypertensive disorder does not necessarily mean that one has pulmonary hypertension. Essential hypertension, for example, primarily affects systemic arterial blood pressure and is not specific to the pulmonary vasculature. Conversely, pulmonary hypertension can occur in the absence of systemic hypertension and can be caused by a variety of factors unrelated to general hypertensive disorders.

Therefore, the presence of a hypertensive disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Heart disease,321588,False,"No.

Rationale: Heart disease is a broad term that encompasses a variety of conditions affecting the heart, including coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias), congenital heart defects, and more. While pulmonary hypertension (PH) can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which are forms of heart disease, not all heart disease is caused by or associated with PH. Therefore, having heart disease does not specifically indicate that one has pulmonary hypertension. Conversely, a person with pulmonary hypertension may develop heart disease, particularly right heart failure, but this is not universally the case for all heart disease patients. Thus, heart disease is not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Disorder of connective tissue,253549,False,"No.

A disorder of connective tissue is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While connective tissue disorders, such as systemic sclerosis or lupus, can be associated with the development of PH, having a connective tissue disorder does not definitively mean that a person has PH. Connective tissue disorders can lead to a variety of complications and affect multiple organ systems, not just the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, while there is an association between connective tissue disorders and PH, the presence of a connective tissue disorder alone is not specific to PH."
Complication,433128,False,"No.

Rationale: The term ""complication"" is too broad and nonspecific to be considered a condition that definitively indicates the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). Complications can arise from a wide variety of medical conditions and are not unique to PH. For example, complications can occur in diseases ranging from diabetes to cancer, and they can include a wide array of issues such as infections, organ dysfunction, or other systemic problems. Therefore, having a complication does not specifically mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Disorder of lung,257907,False,"No.

Rationale: While Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) involves the pulmonary vasculature and can be associated with various lung diseases, it is not specific to a ""disorder of lung."" PH can result from a variety of etiologies, including idiopathic causes, heritable factors, drug-induced conditions, and associations with other systemic diseases such as connective tissue diseases and congenital heart defects. Therefore, having a ""disorder of lung"" does not definitively mean that a person has PH. Conversely, PH can occur without a primary lung disorder, as it can be due to other systemic or idiopathic causes. Thus, the condition ""disorder of lung"" is not specific to the malady ""Pulmonary Hypertension."""
Disorder of artery,321887,False,"No.

Rationale: While Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries, it is not specific to a general ""disorder of artery."" A disorder of an artery can refer to a wide range of conditions affecting any artery in the body, such as atherosclerosis, aneurysms, or peripheral artery disease. These conditions do not necessarily imply the presence of PH. Therefore, having a disorder of an artery does not definitively mean that one has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Sleep disorder,435524,False,"No, a sleep disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH).

Rationale:
A sleep disorder, which encompasses a range of conditions such as insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and narcolepsy, is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While sleep disorders, particularly sleep apnea, can be associated with or exacerbate PH, having a sleep disorder does not definitively indicate that a person has PH. Sleep disorders are common and can occur independently of PH, and they are associated with a wide variety of other health conditions and factors, including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, mental health disorders, and lifestyle factors.

Therefore, the presence of a sleep disorder does not mean that a person definitely has Pulmonary Hypertension, making it not specific to the malady."
Renal failure syndrome,192359,False,"No.

Renal failure syndrome, also known as kidney failure, is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While renal failure can be associated with various cardiovascular conditions, including PH, it is not a definitive indicator that a person has PH. Renal failure can result from a multitude of causes such as diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and other systemic diseases. Therefore, having renal failure does not mean that a person definitely has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Heart failure,316139,False,"No.

Rationale: Heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, heart failure can result from a variety of other conditions as well, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic obstructive lung disease,255573,False,"No.

Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While COPD can be a contributing factor or associated condition that may lead to the development of PH, having COPD does not definitively mean that a person has PH. COPD is a common respiratory condition characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities, typically caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases, such as tobacco smoke.

PH can develop as a complication of COPD, particularly in severe cases, but not all individuals with COPD will develop PH. Therefore, the presence of COPD does not specifically indicate the presence of PH."
Atrial fibrillation,313217,False,"No.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While AF can occur in patients with PH due to the strain and remodeling of the heart, particularly the right atrium, it is not exclusive to PH. AF is a common arrhythmia that can result from a variety of other conditions, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, heart failure, and hyperthyroidism, among others. Therefore, the presence of AF does not definitively indicate that a person has PH."
Chronic renal failure,198185,False,"No.

Chronic renal failure, also known as chronic kidney disease (CKD), is a condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time. While chronic renal failure can have systemic effects and may contribute to the development of various cardiovascular conditions, it is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). 

PH is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries, and it can result from a variety of causes, including idiopathic origins, connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, and chronic lung diseases. Chronic renal failure is not a direct cause of PH, although patients with chronic renal failure may develop PH as a secondary complication due to fluid overload, left heart disease, or other related factors.

Therefore, having chronic renal failure does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension. While there may be an association in some cases, chronic renal failure is not specific to PH."
Disorder of vein,4234997,False,"No.

Rationale: A ""disorder of vein"" is a broad term that encompasses a variety of conditions affecting the veins, such as varicose veins, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chronic venous insufficiency. While pulmonary hypertension (PH) involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries, it is not specifically a disorder of the veins. PH is primarily a condition of the pulmonary vasculature (arteries) and right heart, and while it can be associated with various systemic conditions, it is not exclusively linked to venous disorders. Therefore, having a ""disorder of vein"" does not definitively indicate that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Congestive heart failure,319835,False,"No.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, CHF can result from a variety of other causes as well, such as left ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having CHF does not definitively mean that a person has PH. CHF is a broader condition that can arise from multiple etiologies, not just PH."
Chronic disease of cardiovascular system,4028244,False,"No.

Rationale: While Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is indeed a chronic disease of the cardiovascular system, the condition of having a chronic disease of the cardiovascular system is not specific to PH. There are numerous chronic cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and hypertension, among others. Therefore, having a chronic disease of the cardiovascular system does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Heart valve disorder,4281749,False,"No.

A heart valve disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While heart valve disorders can be associated with or contribute to the development of PH, they are not exclusive to it. Heart valve disorders can occur independently of PH and can be associated with a variety of other cardiovascular conditions, such as left heart disease, which is a common cause of secondary PH but not specific to it.

In summary, having a heart valve disorder does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension, as heart valve disorders can exist in the absence of PH and can be related to other cardiovascular issues."
Chronic heart disease,4134586,False,"No.

Chronic heart disease is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While chronic heart disease can be associated with or lead to the development of PH, it is not exclusive to PH. Chronic heart disease encompasses a wide range of heart conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and valvular heart disease, among others. These conditions can exist independently of PH and are not definitive indicators that a person has PH. Therefore, having chronic heart disease does not mean that a person definitely has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Effect of exposure to physical force,4167864,False,"No.

Rationale: The condition ""effect of exposure to physical force"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). Exposure to physical force can result in a wide range of injuries and conditions, such as trauma, fractures, contusions, and other physical injuries, but it is not directly related to the pathophysiology of PH. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and is associated with various etiologies such as idiopathic causes, connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, and chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having an effect of exposure to physical force does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Complication of procedure,442019,False,"No, a ""complication of procedure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH).

Rationale:
A ""complication of procedure"" is a broad term that can refer to any adverse event or unintended outcome resulting from a medical or surgical procedure. These complications can occur in a wide range of medical contexts and are not specific to any single disease or condition. While it is possible for a complication of a procedure to lead to or exacerbate Pulmonary Hypertension, the presence of a complication of a procedure does not definitively indicate that a patient has PH. Therefore, this condition is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension."
Disorder of pulmonary circulation,433208,False,"No.

Rationale: A ""disorder of pulmonary circulation"" is a broad term that encompasses any condition affecting the blood flow within the lungs. While Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is indeed a specific type of disorder of pulmonary circulation, not all disorders of pulmonary circulation are PH. For example, other conditions such as pulmonary embolism, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), and various forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with left heart disease or lung diseases can also be classified under disorders of pulmonary circulation. Therefore, having a disorder of pulmonary circulation does not definitively mean that one has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Diastolic heart failure,443587,False,"No.

Diastolic heart failure, also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is a condition where the heart's ventricles do not relax properly and thus do not fill adequately during the diastolic phase. This leads to symptoms of heart failure such as dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention. 

While diastolic heart failure can be associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH), it is not specific to PH. Diastolic heart failure can occur due to a variety of other conditions such as hypertension, aging, obesity, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Therefore, having diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. 

In summary, diastolic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension because it can result from multiple other etiologies."
Pulmonary artery finding,4108173,False,"No.

Rationale: A ""pulmonary artery finding"" is a broad term that can encompass a variety of abnormalities or observations related to the pulmonary artery. These findings could include structural abnormalities, changes in pressure, or other pathophysiological changes. While elevated pulmonary arterial pressure is a hallmark of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH), not all findings in the pulmonary artery are specific to PH. For example, a pulmonary artery finding could also be indicative of other conditions such as pulmonary embolism, congenital heart defects, or other forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension not classified under PH. Therefore, the presence of a pulmonary artery finding does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Lymphadenopathy,315085,False,"No.

Lymphadenopathy, which refers to the enlargement of lymph nodes, is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). Lymphadenopathy can be caused by a wide range of conditions, including infections, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, and other systemic diseases. While it is possible for a patient with PH to also have lymphadenopathy, the presence of lymphadenopathy alone does not definitively indicate that a person has PH. Therefore, lymphadenopathy is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic diastolic heart failure,40479576,False,"No.

Chronic diastolic heart failure, also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is a condition where the heart's ventricles are stiff and do not relax properly, leading to inadequate filling of the heart with blood during the diastolic phase. This condition can lead to symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention.

While chronic diastolic heart failure can be associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH), it is not specific to PH. Pulmonary hypertension can develop as a consequence of chronic diastolic heart failure due to increased left atrial pressure being transmitted backward into the pulmonary circulation. However, chronic diastolic heart failure can also occur without the presence of pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension can arise from a variety of other causes unrelated to diastolic heart failure.

Therefore, having chronic diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension, making the condition not specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary embolism,440417,False,"No.

A pulmonary embolism (PE) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While a PE can lead to PH if it causes chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), not all cases of PH are caused by PE. PH can result from a variety of other etiologies, including idiopathic causes, heritable factors, drug-induced conditions, and associations with other diseases such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having a pulmonary embolism does not definitively mean that a person has PH, although it can be one of the contributing factors."
Myeloproliferative disorder,4175485,False,"No.

Rationale: Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) are a group of diseases that involve the overproduction of blood cells in the bone marrow. While MPDs can lead to various complications, including an increased risk of blood clots and other cardiovascular issues, they are not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). 

PH can be associated with a wide range of underlying conditions, including connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, and chronic lung diseases, among others. However, having a myeloproliferative disorder does not definitively mean that a person has PH. Therefore, the presence of a myeloproliferative disorder is not specific to PH."
Human immunodeficiency virus infection,439727,False,"No.

Rationale: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While HIV infection can be one of the etiologies that may lead to the development of PH, having HIV does not definitively mean that a person has PH. PH can result from a variety of causes, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and other associated conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, the presence of HIV infection alone does not confirm the presence of PH, making it not specific to PH."
Immunodeficiency disorder,433740,False,"No, an immunodeficiency disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH).

Rationale:
Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and potentially heart failure. It can result from various etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases.

An immunodeficiency disorder, on the other hand, refers to a state where the immune system's ability to fight infectious disease and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Immunodeficiency disorders can be primary (genetic) or secondary (acquired), and they can lead to increased susceptibility to infections, autoimmune diseases, and certain cancers.

While it is possible for a person with an immunodeficiency disorder to develop PH, the presence of an immunodeficiency disorder does not definitively indicate that the person has PH. Immunodeficiency disorders are not a direct cause of PH, and PH can occur without any underlying immunodeficiency. Therefore, having an immunodeficiency disorder does not mean that a person definitely has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute systolic heart failure,40480603,False,"No.

Acute systolic heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, acute systolic heart failure can result from a variety of other conditions as well, such as ischemic heart disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having acute systolic heart failure does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute diastolic heart failure,40481042,False,"No.

Acute diastolic heart failure, also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is a condition where the heart's ventricles do not relax properly during diastole, leading to inadequate filling of the heart with blood. This condition can result in symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention.

While pulmonary hypertension (PH) can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, it does not specifically cause acute diastolic heart failure. Acute diastolic heart failure can occur due to a variety of reasons, including hypertension, aging, obesity, and other cardiovascular diseases, and is not exclusively linked to pulmonary hypertension.

Therefore, having acute diastolic heart failure does not definitively indicate that a person has pulmonary hypertension. The condition is not specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic disease,442106,False,"No.

Rationale: Idiopathic disease refers to a condition that arises spontaneously or for which the cause is unknown. While idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPH) is a specific subset of pulmonary hypertension (PH), not all cases of PH are idiopathic. PH can result from various other etiologies such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, chronic lung diseases, and more. Therefore, having an idiopathic disease does not definitively mean that one has pulmonary hypertension."
Interstitial lung disease,4119786,False,"No, interstitial lung disease (ILD) is not specific to pulmonary hypertension (PH).

Rationale:
Interstitial lung disease refers to a group of disorders that cause progressive scarring (fibrosis) of lung tissue, which can lead to respiratory issues and reduced oxygen levels in the blood. While ILD can be one of the underlying conditions that may lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to PH. This means that having ILD does not definitively indicate that a person has PH. 

PH can result from a variety of etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases, including ILD. However, ILD itself is a separate condition that can exist without the presence of PH. Therefore, the presence of ILD does not necessarily mean that a person has PH, even though it can be a contributing factor.

In summary, while ILD can be associated with PH, it is not specific to PH, as ILD can occur independently of PH."
Hypertensive heart failure,444101,False,"No.

Rationale: Hypertensive heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, hypertensive heart failure generally refers to heart failure resulting from systemic hypertension (high blood pressure in the systemic circulation) rather than elevated pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. Systemic hypertension can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and eventually heart failure, which is different from the right ventricular dysfunction seen in PH. Therefore, having hypertensive heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic metabolic disorder,4027557,False,"No.

Rationale: A chronic metabolic disorder, such as diabetes mellitus or hypothyroidism, is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While metabolic disorders can contribute to the overall health and may indirectly affect the cardiovascular system, they are not definitive indicators of PH. PH is specifically characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries and requires specific diagnostic criteria such as an increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest, confirmed by right heart catheterization. Chronic metabolic disorders do not directly cause this specific hemodynamic change and can be present in individuals without PH. Therefore, having a chronic metabolic disorder does not mean that a person definitely has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Pulmonary heart disease,4167085,False,"No.

Pulmonary heart disease, also known as cor pulmonale, is a condition that arises from complications in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and eventually right heart failure. While pulmonary hypertension (PH) can indeed lead to pulmonary heart disease, the presence of pulmonary heart disease is not specific to PH alone. Pulmonary heart disease can also result from other conditions that affect the lungs and pulmonary arteries, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, and other chronic lung conditions.

Therefore, having pulmonary heart disease does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension, as it can be caused by a variety of pulmonary conditions."
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure,40480602,False,"No.

Acute on chronic systolic heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, including systolic heart failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure can result from a variety of other conditions as well. These include ischemic heart disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and other systemic conditions that affect the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Therefore, having acute on chronic systolic heart failure does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congenital heart disease,312723,False,"No.

Congenital heart disease is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While congenital heart disease can be one of the etiologies leading to the development of PH, it is not exclusive to PH. Congenital heart disease encompasses a wide range of structural heart defects present from birth, and not all individuals with congenital heart disease will develop PH. Conversely, PH can result from various other causes, including idiopathic origins, connective tissue diseases, chronic lung diseases, and more. Therefore, having congenital heart disease does not definitively mean that a person has PH."
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure,40481043,False,"No.

Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (HFpEF) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, including diastolic heart failure, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure can result from a variety of other conditions as well. These include systemic hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and aging, among others. Therefore, having acute on chronic diastolic heart failure does not definitively indicate that a person has PH."
Dependence on supplemental oxygen,42873170,False,"No.

Rationale: Dependence on supplemental oxygen is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While patients with PH may require supplemental oxygen, especially in advanced stages or if they have associated lung diseases, dependence on supplemental oxygen can also be seen in a variety of other respiratory and cardiac conditions. These include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, severe asthma, congestive heart failure, and other forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxia. Therefore, the presence of dependence on supplemental oxygen does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Mitral valve stenosis,315273,False,"No.

Mitral valve stenosis is a condition characterized by the narrowing of the mitral valve opening, which restricts blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. While mitral valve stenosis can lead to increased pressure in the left atrium and subsequently in the pulmonary vasculature, potentially contributing to pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Pulmonary hypertension can result from a variety of causes, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having mitral valve stenosis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension, although it can be a contributing factor. 

In summary, mitral valve stenosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension because it is just one of many potential causes of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure."
Chronic pulmonary heart disease,315831,False,"No.

Chronic pulmonary heart disease, also known as cor pulmonale, is a condition characterized by the enlargement and failure of the right ventricle of the heart as a response to increased vascular resistance or high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). While chronic pulmonary heart disease can be a consequence of pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to it. 

Pulmonary hypertension can result from various etiologies, and not all cases of pulmonary hypertension will lead to chronic pulmonary heart disease. Additionally, chronic pulmonary heart disease can be caused by other conditions that lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or interstitial lung disease, which may not necessarily be classified under pulmonary hypertension as defined by the mean pulmonary arterial pressure criteria.

Therefore, having chronic pulmonary heart disease does not definitively mean that one has pulmonary hypertension, although it is a common cause."
Hyperuricemia,4147761,False,"No.

Hyperuricemia, which is characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While hyperuricemia can be associated with various cardiovascular and metabolic conditions, including hypertension and heart failure, it is not a definitive indicator of PH. 

PH is a specific condition characterized by elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and its diagnosis relies on hemodynamic measurements obtained through right heart catheterization. The presence of hyperuricemia alone does not confirm the diagnosis of PH, as it can occur in a variety of other conditions such as gout, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic syndrome. Therefore, having hyperuricemia does not mean that a person definitely has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypertensive heart and renal disease with (congestive) heart failure,439696,False,"No.

Rationale: Hypertensive heart and renal disease with (congestive) heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While both conditions involve elevated blood pressure and can lead to heart failure, they are distinct entities with different pathophysiological mechanisms and etiologies.

Pulmonary Hypertension specifically refers to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and potentially right heart failure. It is diagnosed based on an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest, as assessed by right heart catheterization.

On the other hand, hypertensive heart and renal disease with (congestive) heart failure typically involves systemic hypertension (high blood pressure in the systemic circulation) that affects both the heart and kidneys, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy, left heart failure, and renal impairment. This condition is primarily related to systemic hypertension rather than pulmonary hypertension.

Therefore, having hypertensive heart and renal disease with (congestive) heart failure does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension, as the two conditions can occur independently of each other."
Renal tubular disorder,4318544,False,"No.

A renal tubular disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). Renal tubular disorders refer to a group of conditions that affect the renal tubules in the kidneys, leading to issues with the reabsorption and secretion of substances such as electrolytes, water, and waste products. These disorders can result in various symptoms and complications, including electrolyte imbalances, metabolic acidosis, and kidney stones.

While renal tubular disorders can coexist with PH, they are not specific to PH. In other words, having a renal tubular disorder does not definitively indicate that a person has PH. Renal tubular disorders can occur independently of PH and are associated with a variety of other conditions and etiologies. Therefore, the presence of a renal tubular disorder does not specifically point to the diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure,4177862,False,"No, chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

**Rationale:**

Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by long-term low levels of oxygen in the blood, often due to chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, or severe asthma. While chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure can be associated with pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to it. 

Patients with chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication due to the chronic low oxygen levels leading to vasoconstriction in the pulmonary arteries. However, chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure can also occur in the absence of pulmonary hypertension and can be seen in a variety of other pulmonary and systemic conditions.

Therefore, having chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure does not definitively indicate that a person has pulmonary hypertension, even though it can be a contributing factor or associated condition."
Autosomal recessive hereditary disorder,4312226,False,"No.

Rationale: Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) can have various etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. While PH can be associated with heritable conditions, it is not specific to autosomal recessive hereditary disorders. PH can also occur due to other genetic patterns (e.g., autosomal dominant) or non-genetic causes. Therefore, having an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder does not definitively mean that a person has PH."
Venous hypertension,312935,False,"No, venous hypertension is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

**Rationale:**

1. **Definition and Pathophysiology:**
   - **Pulmonary Hypertension (PH):** This condition involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and potentially heart failure. It is diagnosed by measuring the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) via right heart catheterization.
   - **Venous Hypertension:** This refers to elevated pressure within the venous system, often due to conditions like chronic venous insufficiency, deep vein thrombosis, or varicose veins. It primarily affects the veins and is not directly related to the pulmonary arteries.

2. **Etiology and Mechanism:**
   - PH can result from various causes including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases.
   - Venous hypertension is typically associated with issues in the venous return system, such as valve incompetence or obstruction in the veins, and does not directly cause elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries.

3. **Clinical Presentation:**
   - Patients with PH may present with symptoms like dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, syncope, and signs of right heart failure.
   - Venous hypertension often presents with symptoms like leg swelling, varicose veins, skin changes, and ulcers, which are not specific to PH.

4. **Diagnostic Evaluation:**
   - PH is diagnosed through a combination of clinical assessment, echocardiography, pulmonary function tests, and right heart catheterization.
   - Venous hypertension is diagnosed through clinical examination, duplex ultrasound, and sometimes venography.

5. **Overlap and Distinction:**
   - While both conditions involve elevated pressures, they occur in different parts of the circulatory system (pulmonary arteries vs. systemic veins).
   - Having venous hypertension does not imply that one has elevated pressures in the pulmonary arteries, which is necessary for a diagnosis of PH.

Therefore, venous hypertension is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as it does not directly indicate the presence of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure or the associated pathophysiological changes seen in PH."
Sarcoidosis,438688,False,"No.

Sarcoidosis is a condition characterized by the growth of tiny collections of inflammatory cells (granulomas) in different parts of the body, most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes. While sarcoidosis can lead to pulmonary hypertension (PH) as a complication, it is not specific to PH. In other words, having sarcoidosis does not mean that a person definitely has pulmonary hypertension. Sarcoidosis can affect various organs and systems, and not all individuals with sarcoidosis will develop PH. Therefore, sarcoidosis is not a condition that is specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure,44782718,False,"No.

Acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, heart failure itself can result from a variety of other conditions, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies, among others. Therefore, having acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure does not definitively indicate that a person has PH. It is a condition that can be associated with many different underlying causes, not exclusively PH."
Thromboembolic disorder,4159647,False,"No.

A thromboembolic disorder refers to conditions where blood clots form in the blood vessels and can travel to other parts of the body, potentially causing blockages. While chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a specific type of pulmonary hypertension that results from unresolved blood clots in the lungs, not all thromboembolic disorders lead to pulmonary hypertension. 

Pulmonary hypertension can arise from various etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having a thromboembolic disorder does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension, although it can be one of the causes.

Thus, the presence of a thromboembolic disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Hemolytic anemia,435503,False,"No.

Hemolytic anemia is a condition characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells, leading to a shortage of these cells in the bloodstream. It can be caused by various factors, including autoimmune disorders, infections, certain medications, and inherited conditions. While hemolytic anemia can be associated with a variety of systemic diseases and conditions, it is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH).

Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily a condition involving elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries and is associated with right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The etiologies of PH are diverse and include idiopathic causes, heritable factors, drug-induced cases, and associations with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases and chronic lung diseases. Hemolytic anemia is not a direct cause or a specific indicator of PH.

Therefore, the presence of hemolytic anemia does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension. While a patient with PH might have hemolytic anemia due to an underlying condition or as a secondary complication, hemolytic anemia itself is not specific to PH."
Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure,37016114,False,"No.

Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While it can occur in patients with PH, it is not exclusive to this condition. Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure can result from a variety of underlying causes, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, severe asthma, and other chronic lung conditions. It is characterized by a sudden worsening of chronic respiratory failure, leading to inadequate oxygenation of the blood.

Given that acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure can be seen in multiple respiratory and cardiac conditions, it is not specific to PH. Therefore, having acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure does not definitively indicate that a patient has PH."
Autosomal dominant hereditary disorder,4006473,False,"No, an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH).

Rationale:
Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) can have multiple etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. While there are heritable forms of PH, not all cases of PH are due to hereditary factors, and not all hereditary disorders are autosomal dominant. Additionally, PH can be associated with a variety of genetic patterns, including autosomal recessive and other non-Mendelian inheritance patterns.

Therefore, having an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder does not definitively indicate that a person has PH. Conversely, a person with PH may or may not have an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder, as PH can arise from numerous other causes."
Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure,44782733,False,"No.

Rationale: Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, heart failure itself can result from a variety of other conditions, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure does not definitively indicate that a person has PH. It is a condition that can be associated with many different underlying causes, not exclusively PH."
Portal hypertension,192680,False,"No.

Portal hypertension is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). Portal hypertension refers to increased blood pressure within the portal venous system, which is primarily associated with liver diseases such as cirrhosis. While both conditions involve elevated blood pressure in different vascular systems, they are distinct entities with different etiologies and pathophysiological mechanisms.

Pulmonary Hypertension involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and potentially heart failure. On the other hand, portal hypertension involves increased pressure in the portal vein, which can lead to complications such as variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Therefore, having portal hypertension does not mean that a person definitely has pulmonary hypertension. They are separate conditions, and one does not necessarily imply the presence of the other."
Multiple system malformation syndrome,4220676,False,"No.

Multiple system malformation syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). Multiple system malformation syndrome refers to a group of disorders characterized by congenital anomalies affecting multiple organ systems. While some congenital heart defects associated with multiple system malformation syndromes can lead to the development of PH, the presence of multiple system malformation syndrome does not definitively indicate that a person has PH. PH can arise from a variety of etiologies, and not all individuals with multiple system malformation syndrome will develop PH. Therefore, the condition of having multiple system malformation syndrome is not specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure,4140438,False,"No, chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

**Rationale:**

Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood due to inadequate ventilation over a prolonged period. This condition can result from various underlying causes, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, neuromuscular disorders, and severe chest wall deformities.

While pulmonary hypertension (PH) can be associated with chronic lung diseases that may lead to chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, the presence of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure alone does not definitively indicate that a person has PH. Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure can occur in the absence of PH and can be due to other primary respiratory or neuromuscular conditions.

Therefore, having chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure does not mean that a person definitely has pulmonary hypertension, making it not specific to PH."
Acute pulmonary edema,261600,False,"No, acute pulmonary edema is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

**Rationale:**

Acute pulmonary edema is a condition characterized by the rapid accumulation of fluid in the lungs, leading to severe respiratory distress. While it can occur in the context of pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to it. Acute pulmonary edema can result from a variety of other conditions, including:

1. **Left Heart Failure:** The most common cause of acute pulmonary edema is left ventricular failure, where the left side of the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to increased pressure in the pulmonary veins and subsequent fluid leakage into the alveoli.

2. **Acute Myocardial Infarction:** A heart attack can lead to sudden left ventricular dysfunction, causing acute pulmonary edema.

3. **Valvular Heart Disease:** Conditions such as mitral valve stenosis or regurgitation can lead to increased pulmonary venous pressure and pulmonary edema.

4. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):** This can cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to increased permeability of the pulmonary capillaries.

5. **Renal Failure:** Fluid overload in the context of renal failure can lead to pulmonary edema.

6. **High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE):** This is a form of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema that occurs in individuals who rapidly ascend to high altitudes.

Given the multiple potential etiologies of acute pulmonary edema, its presence does not definitively indicate pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, the condition of acute pulmonary edema is not specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension."
Hypoventilation,312603,False,"No.

Hypoventilation, which refers to inadequate ventilation leading to increased levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) in the blood, is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While hypoventilation can contribute to or exacerbate conditions that may lead to PH, it is not a definitive indicator that a person has PH. Hypoventilation can result from a variety of other conditions, including neuromuscular disorders, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and central respiratory control abnormalities, among others. Therefore, the presence of hypoventilation does not necessarily mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congenital septal defect of heart,4245646,False,"No.

A congenital septal defect of the heart, such as an atrial septal defect (ASD) or ventricular septal defect (VSD), is a structural abnormality present at birth that involves a hole in the septum separating the heart's chambers. While congenital septal defects can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs and potentially contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) over time, the presence of a congenital septal defect alone does not definitively indicate that a person has PH.

Pulmonary hypertension is a specific condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which can result from various underlying causes, including congenital heart defects. However, not all individuals with congenital septal defects will develop PH. Therefore, having a congenital septal defect of the heart is not specific to having pulmonary hypertension."
Acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure,36716978,False,"No, acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

**Rationale:**

1. **Definition of the Condition:**
   - Acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is a condition where there is an acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure, characterized by elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood (hypercapnia). This condition is often seen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or other chronic lung diseases.

2. **Association with Pulmonary Hypertension:**
   - While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with chronic lung diseases that may lead to hypercapnic respiratory failure, the presence of acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. It can occur in a variety of other conditions, including but not limited to COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and neuromuscular disorders.

3. **Diagnostic Criteria:**
   - Pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed based on elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) measured by right heart catheterization. Acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is diagnosed based on elevated arterial CO2 levels and clinical signs of respiratory failure.

4. **Overlap and Distinction:**
   - Although there can be an overlap where patients with pulmonary hypertension might develop respiratory failure due to the progression of their disease or associated conditions, the presence of acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure alone does not definitively indicate pulmonary hypertension. It could be due to other primary respiratory conditions.

Therefore, the condition of acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Alveolar hypoventilation,440376,False,"No, alveolar hypoventilation is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH).

**Rationale:**

1. **Definition of Alveolar Hypoventilation:**
   - Alveolar hypoventilation refers to a condition where there is inadequate ventilation in the alveoli, leading to an increase in arterial carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia). This can result from various causes, including central nervous system disorders, neuromuscular diseases, chest wall abnormalities, and severe obesity.

2. **Association with PH:**
   - While alveolar hypoventilation can contribute to or exacerbate pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to PH. Alveolar hypoventilation can occur in a variety of other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and neuromuscular disorders, without the presence of PH.

3. **PH Etiologies:**
   - Pulmonary Hypertension can result from multiple etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Alveolar hypoventilation is not a defining or exclusive feature of PH.

4. **Diagnostic Criteria for PH:**
   - The diagnosis of PH is based on hemodynamic measurements, specifically an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest, as assessed by right heart catheterization. Alveolar hypoventilation is not a diagnostic criterion for PH.

5. **Clinical Presentation:**
   - Patients with PH may present with symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, syncope, and signs of right heart failure. While alveolar hypoventilation can cause dyspnea and fatigue, these symptoms are not exclusive to PH and can be seen in other respiratory and systemic conditions.

In summary, alveolar hypoventilation can be seen in a variety of conditions and is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, the presence of alveolar hypoventilation does not definitively indicate that a patient has PH."
Right ventricular abnormality,4101621,False,"No, right ventricular abnormality is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH).

**Rationale:**
- **Right Ventricular Abnormality:** This term encompasses a range of issues affecting the right ventricle of the heart, including right ventricular hypertrophy, dilation, or dysfunction. These abnormalities can result from various conditions, not just PH.
- **Other Causes:** Right ventricular abnormalities can be seen in conditions such as congenital heart diseases (e.g., Tetralogy of Fallot), right ventricular infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other forms of heart failure.
- **PH Context:** While right ventricular dysfunction is a common consequence of PH due to the increased pressure load on the right side of the heart, its presence alone does not definitively indicate PH. It is a sign that can be associated with multiple cardiac and pulmonary conditions.

Therefore, while right ventricular abnormality is a significant finding in the context of PH, it is not specific to PH alone."
Right ventricular failure,4273632,False,"No.

Right ventricular failure (RVF) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While RVF is a common consequence of PH due to the increased pressure load on the right ventricle, it can also result from other conditions. These include left heart disease, myocardial infarction affecting the right ventricle, congenital heart diseases, and other forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension not related to PH, such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) or pulmonary hypertension due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia.

Therefore, while RVF is a significant and serious complication of PH, its presence does not definitively indicate that a patient has PH, as it can occur in the context of various other cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions."
Cor pulmonale,4307356,False,"No.

Cor pulmonale is a condition characterized by right ventricular hypertrophy and eventual right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension (PH) or other lung disorders. While cor pulmonale can be a consequence of pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to PH alone. Cor pulmonale can also result from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, or other chronic lung conditions that lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries and subsequent right heart strain.

Therefore, while cor pulmonale can occur in patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is not exclusive to this condition and can arise from other pulmonary or cardiac disorders. Hence, the presence of cor pulmonale does not definitively indicate that a patient has pulmonary hypertension."
Fibromatosis,37109980,False,"No.

Fibromatosis refers to a group of conditions characterized by the growth of fibrous or connective tissue, which can form benign tumors or masses. These conditions are not related to the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature that defines Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While fibromatosis can cause localized symptoms depending on the location of the fibrous growths, it does not lead to the hemodynamic changes or right ventricular dysfunction associated with PH.

Therefore, having fibromatosis does not mean that a person definitely has Pulmonary Hypertension. The two conditions are distinct and unrelated in terms of their pathophysiology and clinical presentation."
Neonatal cardiovascular disorder,4180943,False,"No.

Rationale: Neonatal cardiovascular disorders encompass a wide range of heart and blood vessel conditions that can affect newborns. These disorders can include congenital heart defects, arrhythmias, and other structural or functional abnormalities of the heart and blood vessels. While some neonatal cardiovascular disorders could potentially lead to or be associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH), having a neonatal cardiovascular disorder does not specifically mean that the individual definitely has PH. Pulmonary hypertension is a specific condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, and while it can be a consequence of certain cardiovascular disorders, it is not an inevitable outcome of all neonatal cardiovascular disorders. Therefore, the presence of a neonatal cardiovascular disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic pulmonary embolism,44782732,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic pulmonary embolism (CPE) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While CPE can lead to a form of PH known as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), not all cases of CPE result in PH. CPE refers to the presence of blood clots in the pulmonary arteries that have not resolved over time, which can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries and potentially cause PH. However, having a chronic pulmonary embolism does not definitively mean that a person has PH, as the development of PH depends on the extent and impact of the embolism on the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, CPE is not specific to PH."
Hereditary nephropathy,45757752,False,"No, hereditary nephropathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

**Rationale:**

Hereditary nephropathy refers to a group of genetic disorders that affect the kidneys, leading to progressive kidney damage and potentially resulting in chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. Examples include Alport syndrome and other genetic conditions that affect kidney function.

Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which can result from various etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases.

While there can be some overlap in the systemic effects of chronic kidney disease and pulmonary hypertension (e.g., fluid overload leading to increased pulmonary pressures), hereditary nephropathy itself is not a specific indicator of pulmonary hypertension. In other words, having hereditary nephropathy does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. 

Therefore, the condition of hereditary nephropathy is not specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension."
Mitochondrial cytopathy,81539,False,"No.

Mitochondrial cytopathy refers to a group of disorders caused by dysfunction of the mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. These disorders can affect multiple organ systems and present with a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, neurological deficits, and organ failure. While mitochondrial dysfunction can contribute to various systemic issues, it is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH).

Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries and can result from a variety of causes, including idiopathic origins, connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, and chronic lung diseases. Although mitochondrial dysfunction could theoretically contribute to the pathophysiology of PH in some cases, it is not a definitive or specific indicator of PH. Therefore, having mitochondrial cytopathy does not mean that a person definitely has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Pulmonary sarcoidosis,4086243,False,"No, pulmonary sarcoidosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Pulmonary sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that primarily affects the lungs and lymph glands, characterized by the formation of granulomas (small clumps of inflammatory cells). While pulmonary sarcoidosis can lead to complications such as pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. In other words, having pulmonary sarcoidosis does not mean that a person definitely has pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary sarcoidosis can exist without causing elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, and it can present with a variety of other symptoms and complications that are not related to pulmonary hypertension.

Therefore, while pulmonary sarcoidosis can be associated with pulmonary hypertension, it is not a condition that definitively indicates the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiovascular system complication of procedure,43022062,False,"No.

Rationale: A cardiovascular system complication of a procedure is a broad term that can encompass a wide range of issues affecting the cardiovascular system following a medical or surgical procedure. These complications can include arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, bleeding, infection, and other cardiovascular events. While it is possible for a cardiovascular complication to lead to or exacerbate pulmonary hypertension (PH), the presence of a cardiovascular system complication of a procedure does not specifically indicate that a patient has PH. Pulmonary hypertension is a distinct condition characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and requires specific diagnostic criteria, such as right heart catheterization findings. Therefore, having a cardiovascular system complication of a procedure does not definitively mean that the patient has pulmonary hypertension."
Histiocytic syndrome,4130197,False,"No, histiocytic syndrome is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

**Rationale:**
Histiocytic syndromes are a group of disorders characterized by the abnormal proliferation of histiocytes, which are a type of immune cell. These syndromes include conditions such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. They are primarily related to immune system dysfunction and are not directly associated with the pulmonary vasculature or elevated pulmonary arterial pressure.

While it is possible for a patient with a histiocytic syndrome to develop pulmonary hypertension as a secondary complication, the presence of histiocytic syndrome does not definitively indicate that the patient has pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension has a variety of etiologies, and histiocytic syndromes are not a primary or specific cause of this condition. Therefore, having histiocytic syndrome does not mean that a patient definitely has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic right-sided heart failure,4014159,False,"No.

Chronic right-sided heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While chronic right-sided heart failure can be a consequence of PH due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries leading to right ventricular dysfunction, it is not exclusive to PH. Chronic right-sided heart failure can also result from other conditions such as left-sided heart failure, chronic lung diseases (like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease), congenital heart defects, and valvular heart diseases. Therefore, having chronic right-sided heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic cor pulmonale,4195892,False,"No, chronic cor pulmonale is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

**Rationale:**

Chronic cor pulmonale refers to the alteration in the structure and function of the right ventricle of the heart caused by a primary disorder of the respiratory system. While pulmonary hypertension (PH) can indeed lead to chronic cor pulmonale, chronic cor pulmonale can also result from other conditions that affect the pulmonary vasculature and lead to right ventricular dysfunction. These conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, and other chronic lung diseases that cause hypoxia and subsequent pulmonary hypertension.

Therefore, while chronic cor pulmonale can be a consequence of pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to it. Chronic cor pulmonale can arise from various pulmonary conditions, not exclusively from pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiovascular system hereditary disorder,4179992,False,"No.

Rationale: A cardiovascular system hereditary disorder is a broad category that includes a variety of genetic conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. While some hereditary disorders can lead to or be associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH), having a cardiovascular system hereditary disorder does not definitively mean that a person has PH. PH can result from multiple etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, the presence of a cardiovascular system hereditary disorder is not specific to PH, as it does not guarantee that PH is present."
Pulmonary vein finding,4119821,False,"No.

A ""pulmonary vein finding"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). Pulmonary vein findings can be associated with a variety of conditions, including but not limited to pulmonary vein stenosis, pulmonary vein thrombosis, and conditions related to left heart disease such as mitral valve disease or left ventricular dysfunction. These conditions can lead to elevated pressures in the pulmonary veins, but they do not necessarily indicate Pulmonary Hypertension, which is specifically characterized by elevated pressures in the pulmonary arteries, not the veins.

Therefore, while a pulmonary vein finding might be present in some cases of PH, it is not specific to PH, and its presence does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Infection by Schistosoma,436038,False,"No.

Infection by Schistosoma, also known as schistosomiasis, is a parasitic disease caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. While schistosomiasis can lead to various complications, including liver and intestinal damage, it is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). 

Schistosomiasis can indeed be a risk factor for developing PH, particularly in cases where the infection leads to significant liver damage and subsequent portal hypertension, which can contribute to the development of PH. However, having a Schistosoma infection does not definitively mean that a person has PH. Many individuals with schistosomiasis do not develop PH, and the presence of the infection alone is not sufficient to diagnose PH.

Therefore, while there is an association between schistosomiasis and PH, the condition of being infected by Schistosoma is not specific to PH."
Langerhans cell histiocytosis,4278365,False,"No.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell that normally helps regulate the immune system. LCH can affect various organs, including the bones, skin, lungs, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. The clinical presentation of LCH can vary widely, ranging from isolated bone lesions to multisystem disease.

While LCH can involve the lungs and potentially lead to pulmonary complications, it is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). PH is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which can result from a variety of causes, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases.

Although LCH can cause lung disease and potentially contribute to the development of PH in some cases, the presence of LCH does not definitively indicate that a person has PH. Therefore, Langerhans cell histiocytosis is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension."
Pulmonary thrombosis,4239826,False,"No.

Pulmonary thrombosis, which refers to the formation of a blood clot in the pulmonary arteries, is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While pulmonary thrombosis can lead to a form of pulmonary hypertension known as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), it is not the only cause of PH. PH can result from a variety of other etiologies, including idiopathic causes, heritable factors, drug-induced conditions, and associations with other diseases such as connective tissue diseases and chronic lung diseases.

Therefore, having a pulmonary thrombosis does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension, as pulmonary thrombosis can occur independently of PH and can also lead to other conditions such as acute pulmonary embolism. Conversely, a person with PH may or may not have a history of pulmonary thrombosis, depending on the underlying cause of their PH."
Biventricular congestive heart failure,4242669,False,"No.

Biventricular congestive heart failure (CHF) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and eventually right heart failure, which can contribute to biventricular heart failure, biventricular CHF can result from a variety of other conditions as well. These include left-sided heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, valvular heart diseases, and systemic hypertension, among others.

Therefore, the presence of biventricular congestive heart failure does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension, as it can be caused by multiple other cardiac conditions."
Angiomatosis,4006951,False,"No.

Angiomatosis is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple angiomas, which are benign tumors derived from blood vessels. It is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While angiomatosis can be associated with various syndromes and conditions, it is not a diagnostic criterion or a specific indicator for PH. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily diagnosed based on hemodynamic measurements, such as an elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and is associated with symptoms like dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of right heart failure. Angiomatosis does not directly relate to the pathophysiological mechanisms or diagnostic criteria of PH. Therefore, having angiomatosis does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Capillary hemangioma,4291592,False,"No, capillary hemangioma is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

**Rationale:**

1. **Definition and Nature of Capillary Hemangioma:**
   - A capillary hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor composed of an abnormal overgrowth of blood vessels. It is commonly seen in infants and usually appears as a red or purple mark on the skin. It is not related to the pulmonary vasculature or the hemodynamic changes seen in pulmonary hypertension.

2. **Pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension:**
   - Pulmonary hypertension involves elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. It is a condition affecting the pulmonary vasculature and is diagnosed through specific hemodynamic criteria (mPAP ≥ 20 mmHg at rest).

3. **Etiological Differences:**
   - Pulmonary hypertension can result from various causes, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other systemic conditions like connective tissue diseases and chronic lung diseases. Capillary hemangiomas, on the other hand, are localized vascular anomalies and do not share a common pathophysiological mechanism with pulmonary hypertension.

4. **Clinical Presentation:**
   - The symptoms and signs of pulmonary hypertension (e.g., dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, syncope, right heart failure) are related to the increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries and the resultant strain on the right side of the heart. Capillary hemangiomas typically present as superficial skin lesions and do not cause systemic symptoms related to pulmonary hypertension.

5. **Diagnostic Evaluation:**
   - The diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension involves specific tests such as echocardiography, pulmonary function tests, and right heart catheterization. Capillary hemangiomas are usually diagnosed based on their characteristic appearance and do not require such extensive cardiovascular evaluation.

Given these points, capillary hemangioma is not a condition that, if present, would definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, the answer is ""no."""
Acute right-sided heart failure,4233424,False,"No.

Rationale: Acute right-sided heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can lead to right-sided heart failure due to the increased pressure load on the right ventricle, right-sided heart failure can also result from other conditions. These include left-sided heart failure, myocardial infarction affecting the right ventricle, pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congenital heart diseases, among others. Therefore, the presence of acute right-sided heart failure does not definitively indicate that a patient has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Right heart failure secondary to left heart failure,4195785,False,"No.

Right heart failure secondary to left heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While right heart failure can occur in the context of PH due to the increased pressure load on the right ventricle, it can also occur due to other conditions, particularly left heart failure. In left heart failure, the left ventricle fails to pump blood effectively, leading to increased pressure in the left atrium and pulmonary veins, which can subsequently cause pulmonary congestion and increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation. This increased pressure can then lead to right heart failure, a condition known as ""cor pulmonale.""

Therefore, right heart failure secondary to left heart failure can be seen in the context of left heart disease without the presence of PH. Thus, having right heart failure secondary to left heart failure does not definitively indicate that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypertension secondary to drug,4108213,False,"No.

Rationale: Hypertension secondary to drug use refers to elevated blood pressure that is specifically caused by the intake of certain medications or substances. While drug-induced hypertension can contribute to or exacerbate pulmonary hypertension (PH), it is not specific to PH. Drug-induced hypertension can affect systemic blood pressure and may not necessarily involve the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, having hypertension secondary to drug use does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension involves elevated pressure specifically within the pulmonary arteries, which is a distinct condition from systemic hypertension caused by drugs."
Chronic drug-induced interstitial lung disorders,4112814,False,"No.

Chronic drug-induced interstitial lung disorders are not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While chronic drug-induced interstitial lung disorders can lead to lung damage and potentially contribute to the development of PH, they are not exclusive to PH. Interstitial lung disorders can result from various causes, including exposure to certain drugs, and can lead to a range of pulmonary complications, not just PH. Therefore, having chronic drug-induced interstitial lung disorders does not definitively mean that a person has PH."
Neurofibroma,4300676,False,"No.

A neurofibroma is a benign nerve sheath tumor in the peripheral nervous system, typically associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder. Neurofibromas are not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While PH can be associated with various underlying conditions, neurofibromas themselves do not directly cause or indicate the presence of PH. Therefore, having a neurofibroma does not mean that a person definitely has Pulmonary Hypertension."
High output heart failure,4004279,False,"No.

High output heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). High output heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to meet the body's metabolic demands despite an increased cardiac output. This can occur due to various causes such as severe anemia, hyperthyroidism, arteriovenous fistulas, and other conditions that increase the body's demand for blood flow.

While PH can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, it is typically associated with low output heart failure due to the increased resistance in the pulmonary vasculature. High output heart failure, on the other hand, is not a direct consequence of PH and can occur independently of it. Therefore, having high output heart failure does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis,4174275,False,"No.

Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease that primarily affects women of childbearing age. It is characterized by the abnormal growth of smooth muscle-like cells in the lungs, lymphatic system, and kidneys, leading to the formation of cysts and obstruction of airways, blood vessels, and lymphatics. While LAM can lead to pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to the obstruction of pulmonary vasculature and subsequent increased pressure, it is not specific to PH. 

In other words, having pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis does not mean that a person definitely has pulmonary hypertension. LAM can be associated with PH, but it is not a definitive indicator of PH. Therefore, the condition of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis is not specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension."
Inflammatory disorder of mediastinum,4189294,False,"No.

An inflammatory disorder of the mediastinum is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While an inflammatory disorder of the mediastinum can potentially affect the pulmonary vasculature and contribute to conditions that might lead to PH, it is not a definitive indicator that a person has PH. PH can result from a variety of etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having an inflammatory disorder of the mediastinum does not mean that a person definitely has PH."
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease,4232485,False,"No.

Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare form of pulmonary hypertension (PH) that specifically affects the small veins in the lungs, leading to increased pulmonary arterial pressure. While PVOD is a cause of PH, it is not specific to PH. This means that if a patient has PVOD, they will have PH, but having PH does not necessarily mean the patient has PVOD. PH can result from a variety of other etiologies, including idiopathic causes, connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, and chronic lung diseases, among others. Therefore, the presence of PVOD indicates PH, but PH can exist without PVOD."
Sclerosing mediastinitis,4249898,False,"No.

Sclerosing mediastinitis is a rare condition characterized by the excessive growth of fibrous tissue within the mediastinum, which can compress and obstruct mediastinal structures such as blood vessels, airways, and the esophagus. While sclerosing mediastinitis can lead to complications that might affect the pulmonary vasculature and potentially contribute to secondary forms of pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

In other words, having sclerosing mediastinitis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. Sclerosing mediastinitis can exist without causing pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension can arise from a multitude of other causes unrelated to sclerosing mediastinitis. Therefore, the condition of sclerosing mediastinitis is not specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic hemolytic anemia,45768941,False,"No.

Chronic hemolytic anemia is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While chronic hemolytic anemia can be associated with PH, particularly in conditions like sickle cell disease where chronic hemolysis can lead to pulmonary vascular changes and subsequent PH, it is not specific to PH. Chronic hemolytic anemia can occur in a variety of other conditions and does not definitively indicate the presence of PH. Therefore, having chronic hemolytic anemia does not mean that a person definitely has PH."
Acquired hemangiomatosis,4111945,False,"No, acquired hemangiomatosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Acquired hemangiomatosis is a condition characterized by the abnormal proliferation of blood vessels, leading to the formation of multiple hemangiomas. While hemangiomas can occur in various organs, including the skin, liver, and lungs, their presence does not definitively indicate pulmonary hypertension (PH).

Pulmonary hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries, which can result from a variety of underlying causes, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. The presence of hemangiomas, even within the lungs, does not necessarily correlate with the elevated pulmonary arterial pressure that defines PH.

Therefore, while hemangiomatosis may be observed in patients with various conditions, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Obesity associated disorder,4176962,False,"No.

Rationale: Obesity is a risk factor for many cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions, including pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, the presence of an obesity-associated disorder does not specifically indicate that a person has PH. Obesity can lead to a variety of health issues such as obstructive sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome, and left heart disease, which can indirectly contribute to the development of PH. Nonetheless, having an obesity-associated disorder does not definitively mean that a person has PH, as PH can result from a wide range of other etiologies and conditions. Therefore, the condition of having an obesity-associated disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension."
Indian childhood cirrhosis,4268006,False,"No, Indian childhood cirrhosis is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

**Rationale:**

Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC) is a form of liver disease that primarily affects children in India. It is characterized by severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, often leading to liver failure. The etiology of ICC is believed to be multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition and environmental factors such as exposure to copper.

Pulmonary Hypertension (PH), on the other hand, is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and potentially heart failure. PH can be associated with various underlying conditions, including connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, and chronic lung diseases, but it is not specifically linked to Indian childhood cirrhosis.

While liver diseases, in general, can sometimes lead to complications that might include pulmonary hypertension (for example, portopulmonary hypertension in the context of cirrhosis), Indian childhood cirrhosis itself is not a specific indicator of PH. Therefore, having Indian childhood cirrhosis does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis,4121621,False,"No.

Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) is a rare vascular disorder characterized by the proliferation of capillaries within the lungs, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, PCH is just one of many potential causes of PH. While PCH can result in PH, having PCH does not mean that PH is the only possible condition. PH can arise from a variety of other etiologies, including idiopathic causes, connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, chronic lung diseases, and more.

Therefore, the presence of pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension, as PH can be caused by numerous other conditions."
Chronic pulmonary thromboembolism without pulmonary hypertension,45771016,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic pulmonary thromboembolism (CPE) without pulmonary hypertension (PH) indicates the presence of blood clots in the pulmonary arteries that have not led to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. Pulmonary hypertension is specifically defined by an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest, as assessed by right heart catheterization. If a patient has chronic pulmonary thromboembolism but does not have elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, they do not meet the criteria for pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having chronic pulmonary thromboembolism without pulmonary hypertension does not mean the patient definitely has pulmonary hypertension."
CK syndrome,36676440,False,"No, CK syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension.

**Rationale:**

CK syndrome, also known as Coffin-Keuhne syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and other congenital anomalies. It is not directly related to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While individuals with CK syndrome may have various health issues, PH is not a defining or specific feature of this syndrome.

Pulmonary Hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which can result from various etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. However, CK syndrome is not one of the conditions typically associated with PH.

Therefore, having CK syndrome does not mean that a person definitely has Pulmonary Hypertension, making CK syndrome not specific to PH."
Acute on chronic right-sided congestive heart failure,37309625,False,"No.

Acute on chronic right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). While right-sided CHF can be a consequence of PH due to the increased pressure load on the right ventricle, it can also result from other conditions. These include left-sided heart failure, chronic lung diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease), congenital heart defects, and other causes of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Therefore, having acute on chronic right-sided CHF does not definitively mean that a person has PH, as it can be caused by a variety of other conditions."
Autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia due to G6PC3 deficiency,37204406,False,"No.

Autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia due to G6PC3 deficiency is a genetic disorder characterized by a severe reduction in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell essential for fighting infections. This condition is primarily associated with recurrent bacterial infections, failure to thrive, and other hematological abnormalities. While it is a serious condition, it is not specifically linked to Pulmonary Hypertension (PH).

Pulmonary Hypertension is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and potentially heart failure. It can result from various etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases.

There is no direct or specific link between G6PC3 deficiency and the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia due to G6PC3 deficiency does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Developmental hereditary disorder,4180651,False,"No.

Rationale: A developmental hereditary disorder is a broad category that encompasses a wide range of genetic conditions that affect development. While some hereditary disorders can be associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH), having a developmental hereditary disorder does not specifically indicate that a person has PH. PH can result from various etiologies, including idiopathic, heritable, drug-induced, and associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. However, not all developmental hereditary disorders lead to PH. Therefore, the presence of a developmental hereditary disorder is not specific to PH."
Familial pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis,4121809,False,"No.

Familial pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the proliferation of capillary blood vessels within the lungs, leading to pulmonary hypertension (PH). While PCH can indeed cause PH, it is not specific to PH. This means that if a person has familial pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis, they may develop PH, but having PH does not necessarily mean that the person has familial pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. PH can result from a variety of other etiologies, as mentioned in the description, including idiopathic causes, connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, and chronic lung diseases. Therefore, the condition of familial pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis is not specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension."
