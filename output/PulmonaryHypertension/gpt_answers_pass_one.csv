Measurement finding,4041436,False,"No, the condition ""Measurement finding"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. A measurement finding could refer to any type of measurement taken during a medical evaluation, such as blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, etc. While measurements such as elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest are indicative of Pulmonary Hypertension, the term ""Measurement finding"" is too broad and non-specific to definitively link to Pulmonary Hypertension. Additional clinical evaluation and diagnostic tests would be needed to confirm a diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypertensive disorder,316866,False,"No

Rationale: A hypertensive disorder is a general term used to describe conditions characterized by high blood pressure. While pulmonary hypertension specifically refers to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, a hypertensive disorder can refer to high blood pressure in general, which can affect various parts of the body, not just the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, having a hypertensive disorder does not necessarily mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Heart disease,321588,False,"No, the condition ""heart disease"" is not specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. Heart disease is a broad term that encompasses a variety of conditions affecting the heart, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and more. While Pulmonary Hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, not all individuals with heart disease will develop Pulmonary Hypertension. Additionally, Pulmonary Hypertension can have various underlying causes beyond heart disease, such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having heart disease does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Disorder of connective tissue,253549,True,"Yes, a disorder of connective tissue can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Connective tissue diseases, such as systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and systemic lupus erythematosus, are known to be associated with the development of Pulmonary Hypertension. In these cases, the presence of a connective tissue disorder can lead to the development of PH, making it a specific condition for this malady."
Complication,433128,False,"No, the condition ""Complication"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Complications can arise from various medical conditions, including Pulmonary Hypertension, but having a complication does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension. Complications are additional problems that can occur as a result of a primary disease or condition, and they can be seen in a wide range of medical situations. Therefore, the presence of a complication does not necessarily indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Disorder of lung,257907,False,"No. A disorder of the lung is a very broad and nonspecific condition that can encompass a wide range of pulmonary issues, such as infections, obstructive lung diseases, interstitial lung diseases, etc. While pulmonary hypertension can be associated with certain lung diseases, it is not specific to just a general disorder of the lung. Therefore, having a disorder of the lung does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Disorder of artery,321887,False,"No, the condition ""Disorder of artery"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension does involve elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, it is a specific condition characterized by an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) greater than or equal to 20 mmHg at rest. The term ""Disorder of artery"" is too broad and could encompass a wide range of conditions affecting various arteries in the body, not just the pulmonary arteries as seen in Pulmonary Hypertension."
Sleep disorder,435524,False,"No, a sleep disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may experience symptoms such as fatigue and difficulty sleeping due to their condition, having a sleep disorder does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. Sleep disorders can have various causes and are not exclusive to pulmonary hypertension."
Renal failure syndrome,192359,False,"No

Rationale: Renal failure syndrome is a condition related to kidney dysfunction, which can lead to various complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and metabolic disturbances. While renal failure syndrome can have systemic effects on the body, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily a condition affecting the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular function, and while it can be associated with other conditions such as connective tissue diseases or congenital heart defects, renal failure syndrome is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension."
Heart failure,316139,True,"Yes, heart failure is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Rationale: Pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has pulmonary hypertension, they may develop heart failure as a complication of the condition. However, not all patients with heart failure will have pulmonary hypertension, as heart failure can have various causes other than pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic obstructive lung disease,255573,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. While COPD can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all patients with COPD will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having COPD does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension. On the other hand, pulmonary hypertension can be associated with various conditions, including COPD, but it is not specific to COPD."
Atrial fibrillation,313217,False,"No, atrial fibrillation is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While atrial fibrillation can be seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia characterized by irregular and often rapid heart rate, which can occur in various cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. In the context of pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation may develop as a result of right heart strain and dilation, but it is not a necessary component for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having atrial fibrillation does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic renal failure,198185,False,"No, chronic renal failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While chronic renal failure can lead to various complications and comorbidities, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, rather than kidney dysfunction. Therefore, having chronic renal failure does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Disorder of vein,4234997,False,"No, a disorder of the vein is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, it specifically refers to the pulmonary arteries rather than veins. Additionally, a disorder of the vein could refer to a wide range of conditions affecting veins throughout the body, which may not necessarily be directly related to the pathophysiology of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congestive heart failure,319835,False,"No

Rationale: While congestive heart failure can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. There are various causes of congestive heart failure, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and valvular heart disease, among others. Therefore, having congestive heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic disease of cardiovascular system,4028244,False,"No, the condition ""Chronic disease of cardiovascular system"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is a specific condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. While Pulmonary Hypertension does involve the cardiovascular system, it is a distinct and specific condition that is not encompassed by a general term like ""Chronic disease of cardiovascular system."""
Heart valve disorder,4281749,False,"No, a heart valve disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right heart failure, which can lead to tricuspid valve regurgitation, a heart valve disorder is not a defining characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, not by heart valve abnormalities."
Chronic heart disease,4134586,False,"No, chronic heart disease is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, chronic heart disease is a broad term that encompasses various conditions affecting the heart, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Therefore, having chronic heart disease does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Effect of exposure to physical force,4167864,False,"No, the condition ""Effect of exposure to physical force"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While physical force or trauma can potentially lead to certain medical conditions or exacerbate existing ones, it is not a defining characteristic or specific symptom of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, as described in the provided description. Therefore, the presence of the condition ""Effect of exposure to physical force"" does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Complication of procedure,442019,False,"No, the condition ""Complication of procedure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Complications of procedures can occur in a variety of medical conditions and situations, not just in the context of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, which is not directly related to complications of procedures."
Disorder of pulmonary circulation,433208,True,"Yes, the condition ""Disorder of pulmonary circulation"" is specific to the malady Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension is a disorder of pulmonary circulation characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, if someone has a disorder of pulmonary circulation, they definitely have the malady Pulmonary Hypertension."
Diastolic heart failure,443587,False,"No, diastolic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Diastolic heart failure is a condition where the heart's left ventricle has difficulty relaxing and filling with blood, leading to elevated pressures in the heart and lungs. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, diastolic heart failure can have various causes, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease. Therefore, having diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary artery finding,4108173,True,"Yes, a pulmonary artery finding would be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. In PH, there is elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which would be reflected in findings related to the pulmonary artery. This could include imaging studies showing dilated pulmonary arteries, echocardiography findings of increased pulmonary artery pressure, or invasive procedures such as right heart catheterization confirming elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Therefore, if a patient has a pulmonary artery finding, it is highly suggestive of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Lymphadenopathy,315085,False,"No, lymphadenopathy is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Lymphadenopathy refers to the enlargement of lymph nodes, which can be caused by a wide range of conditions such as infections, inflammatory diseases, and malignancies.

Therefore, having lymphadenopathy does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic diastolic heart failure,40479576,False,"No.

Chronic diastolic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, chronic diastolic heart failure can have various causes, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having chronic diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a patient has pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary embolism,440417,False,"No

Rationale: While pulmonary embolism can present with symptoms similar to pulmonary hypertension, such as dyspnea and chest pain, it is a separate condition characterized by a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries, usually caused by a blood clot. While pulmonary embolism can lead to right heart strain and potentially right heart failure, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having a pulmonary embolism does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Myeloproliferative disorder,4175485,False,"No

Rationale: Myeloproliferative disorders are a group of conditions characterized by the overproduction of blood cells in the bone marrow. While these disorders can lead to various complications, they are not specifically associated with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having a myeloproliferative disorder does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
Human immunodeficiency virus infection,439727,False,"No, human immunodeficiency virus infection is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with HIV infection may develop various cardiovascular complications, including pulmonary hypertension, the presence of HIV infection does not definitively mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can have various causes, as mentioned in the description, and HIV infection is just one of many potential contributing factors. Therefore, the presence of HIV infection does not guarantee the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Immunodeficiency disorder,433740,False,"No, an immunodeficiency disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While patients with immunodeficiency disorders may be at an increased risk for developing various medical conditions, including pulmonary hypertension, having an immunodeficiency disorder does not definitively mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which is not a direct consequence of immunodeficiency. Therefore, the presence of an immunodeficiency disorder does not necessarily indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Acute systolic heart failure,40480603,False,"No, acute systolic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, acute systolic heart failure can have various causes, including myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, and other conditions. Therefore, having acute systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Acute diastolic heart failure,40481042,False,"No

Rationale: Acute diastolic heart failure is a specific condition related to heart failure, but it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, not all cases of heart failure, including acute diastolic heart failure, are directly caused by pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having acute diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Idiopathic disease,442106,True,"Yes, the condition of idiopathic disease is specific to the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. Idiopathic disease refers to a condition where the underlying cause is unknown, and Pulmonary Hypertension can be idiopathic in nature. In fact, Pulmonary Hypertension can result from various etiologies, including idiopathic causes. Therefore, if a patient is diagnosed with idiopathic disease, they may definitely have the malady of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Interstitial lung disease,4119786,False,"No

Rationale: Interstitial lung disease is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While interstitial lung disease can be associated with pulmonary hypertension as a secondary condition, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can be caused by various etiologies, including but not limited to interstitial lung disease. Therefore, having interstitial lung disease does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Hypertensive heart failure,444101,False,"No.

Rationale:
While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, not all cases of hypertensive heart failure are specifically due to pulmonary hypertension. Hypertensive heart failure can also be caused by other conditions such as systemic hypertension affecting the left side of the heart. Therefore, having hypertensive heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic metabolic disorder,4027557,False,"No, a chronic metabolic disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While certain metabolic disorders may contribute to the development of PH, having a chronic metabolic disorder does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension. PH is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which is not a direct result of a chronic metabolic disorder. Additional diagnostic evaluation and assessment would be needed to confirm the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension in an individual with a chronic metabolic disorder."
Pulmonary heart disease,4167085,True,"Yes, pulmonary heart disease is specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary heart disease, also known as cor pulmonale, is a condition that occurs when the right side of the heart becomes enlarged and strained due to high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). Therefore, if a person has pulmonary heart disease, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension as the underlying cause."
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure,40480602,False,"No

Rationale: Acute on chronic systolic heart failure is a condition characterized by a sudden worsening of symptoms in a patient with pre-existing heart failure, specifically related to reduced ejection fraction. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have acute on chronic systolic heart failure. Therefore, having acute on chronic systolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a patient has pulmonary hypertension."
Congenital heart disease,312723,True,"Yes, congenital heart disease is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Congenital heart disease is a known risk factor for the development of pulmonary hypertension. Patients with congenital heart defects, especially those with left-to-right shunts, can develop pulmonary hypertension due to increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure overload on the pulmonary vasculature. This can lead to remodeling of the pulmonary arteries and ultimately result in pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has congenital heart disease, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of their underlying condition."
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure,40481043,False,"No

Rationale: Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure is a specific condition related to heart failure, specifically involving impaired relaxation of the heart muscle during diastole. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, not all cases of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure will necessarily have pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having acute on chronic diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Dependence on supplemental oxygen,42873170,True,"Yes, dependence on supplemental oxygen can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop severe symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue due to the elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction. As the disease progresses, patients may require supplemental oxygen to help with breathing and oxygenation. Therefore, if a patient has a dependence on supplemental oxygen, it is highly likely that they have Pulmonary Hypertension. However, it is important to confirm the diagnosis through appropriate diagnostic tests such as echocardiography and right heart catheterization."
Mitral valve stenosis,315273,False,"No, mitral valve stenosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Mitral valve stenosis is a condition where the mitral valve in the heart is narrowed, leading to decreased blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. While mitral valve stenosis can lead to increased pressure in the left side of the heart, it is not directly related to the elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature seen in pulmonary hypertension. These two conditions have different pathophysiologies and etiologies, and having mitral valve stenosis does not necessarily mean that a person will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic pulmonary heart disease,315831,True,"Yes, chronic pulmonary heart disease is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Chronic pulmonary heart disease is a condition that results from long-standing pulmonary hypertension, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately, heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has chronic pulmonary heart disease, they definitely have the underlying malady of Pulmonary Hypertension. On the other hand, not all patients with Pulmonary Hypertension will develop chronic pulmonary heart disease, as it is a complication that can arise from the progression of the disease."
Hyperuricemia,4147761,False,"No, hyperuricemia is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Hyperuricemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, which can lead to conditions such as gout. While hyperuricemia can be present in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, having hyperuricemia does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypertensive heart and renal disease with (congestive) heart failure,439696,False,"No, the condition ""Hypertensive heart and renal disease with (congestive) heart failure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. The condition mentioned focuses on heart and renal disease with heart failure, which may have different underlying causes and pathophysiology than Pulmonary Hypertension. While heart failure can be a complication of Pulmonary Hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the condition. Therefore, having the condition does not definitively mean that one has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Renal tubular disorder,4318544,False,"No, a renal tubular disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While there may be some associations between renal tubular disorders and certain types of pulmonary hypertension, having a renal tubular disorder does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is primarily related to issues within the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricular dysfunction, rather than renal tubular disorders."
Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure,4177862,True,"Yes, chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure is a condition where there is a long-term decrease in the oxygen levels in the blood, which can be caused by conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, or sleep apnea. In the case of Pulmonary Hypertension, the elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature can lead to decreased oxygen levels in the blood, resulting in chronic hypoxemia. Therefore, if a patient has chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure, it is possible that they may also have Pulmonary Hypertension. However, not all patients with chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure will have Pulmonary Hypertension, as there can be other underlying causes for the hypoxemia."
Autosomal recessive hereditary disorder,4312226,False,"No, the condition of autosomal recessive hereditary disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can be hereditary in some cases, it can also be caused by various other factors such as drug-induced, connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder does not definitively mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Venous hypertension,312935,False,"No, venous hypertension is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Venous hypertension refers to high blood pressure in the veins, typically in the lower extremities. While pulmonary hypertension involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, it is a separate condition that affects the lungs and heart. While venous hypertension can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease."
Sarcoidosis,438688,False,"No, sarcoidosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While sarcoidosis can affect the lungs and lead to pulmonary complications, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in various organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. It can present with respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and chest pain, but it is not a direct cause of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having sarcoidosis does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
Acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure,44782718,False,"No, acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure can have various causes, including but not limited to coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Therefore, having acute combined systolic and diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Thromboembolic disorder,4159647,False,"No, thromboembolic disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While chronic thromboembolic disease is listed as an exclusion for pulmonary arterial hypertension, not all cases of thromboembolic disorder necessarily lead to pulmonary hypertension. Thromboembolic disorder refers to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream, potentially causing a blockage in a blood vessel. This can lead to various conditions such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or stroke, among others. While pulmonary embolism can lead to pulmonary hypertension in some cases, it is not a definitive indicator of the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Hemolytic anemia,435503,False,"No, hemolytic anemia is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While hemolytic anemia can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension due to chronic hemolysis in the setting of increased pulmonary pressures, it is not a defining characteristic of the disease. Hemolytic anemia can have various causes such as autoimmune disorders, infections, medications, or inherited conditions, and can occur independently of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having hemolytic anemia does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure,37016114,False,"No, acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure refers to a condition where there is a sudden worsening of respiratory function in a patient with pre-existing chronic respiratory insufficiency. This can be caused by various conditions such as exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), among others. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may experience hypoxemia as a result of the disease process, acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure is not a defining characteristic of Pulmonary Hypertension. It is important to consider the underlying cause of the respiratory failure in each individual case to provide appropriate management and treatment."
Autosomal dominant hereditary disorder,4006473,False,"No, the condition of an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can be hereditary in some cases, it can also be idiopathic or associated with other conditions. Therefore, having an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder does not definitively mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure,44782733,False,"No, acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure refers to a condition where there is a combination of both systolic dysfunction (reduced ejection fraction) and diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation or increased stiffness of the heart muscle) leading to heart failure symptoms. This condition can have various underlying causes such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, or cardiomyopathies.

While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure as a complication of the disease, not all cases of acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure are specifically related to Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Portal hypertension,192680,False,"No

Rationale: Portal hypertension is a condition characterized by increased pressure in the portal vein system, which carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver. While both portal hypertension and pulmonary hypertension involve elevated blood pressure, they occur in different vascular systems (portal vein system vs. pulmonary vasculature) and have distinct underlying causes and manifestations. Therefore, having portal hypertension does not necessarily mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Multiple system malformation syndrome,4220676,False,"No, the condition ""Multiple system malformation syndrome"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Multiple system malformation syndrome refers to a group of disorders characterized by abnormalities affecting multiple organ systems, including structural defects, developmental delays, and intellectual disabilities. While some individuals with multiple system malformation syndrome may have pulmonary hypertension as a comorbidity, it is not a defining feature of the condition. Pulmonary hypertension is a specific medical condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, as described in the provided description. Therefore, having multiple system malformation syndrome does not definitively mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure,4140438,True,"Yes, chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood due to inadequate ventilation. In the context of Pulmonary Hypertension, chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure can occur as a result of the underlying lung disease or respiratory muscle weakness that may be contributing to the development of PH. 

Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may develop chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure as the disease progresses, leading to worsening respiratory symptoms and gas exchange abnormalities. Therefore, if a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension presents with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, it is highly likely that the two conditions are related."
Acute pulmonary edema,261600,False,"No

Rationale: Acute pulmonary edema is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the lungs, leading to difficulty breathing, coughing, and potentially life-threatening respiratory distress. While acute pulmonary edema can be a complication of pulmonary hypertension, it is not specific to the condition. Acute pulmonary edema can also be caused by other conditions such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, or kidney failure. Therefore, having acute pulmonary edema does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Hypoventilation,312603,False,"No, hypoventilation is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Hypoventilation refers to decreased ventilation of the lungs, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide levels and a decrease in oxygen levels in the blood. While hypoventilation can occur in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension due to impaired gas exchange, it is not a specific symptom or diagnostic criteria for the condition. Other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neuromuscular disorders, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and central sleep apnea can also cause hypoventilation. Therefore, the presence of hypoventilation alone does not definitively indicate Pulmonary Hypertension."
Congenital septal defect of heart,4245646,True,"Yes, a congenital septal defect of the heart can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Congenital heart defects, including septal defects, can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension over time. The increased blood flow can lead to elevated pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, ultimately resulting in right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which are characteristic features of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has a congenital septal defect of the heart, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result."
Acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure,36716978,False,"No.

Rationale:
Acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is a condition characterized by an acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the blood. While this condition can be seen in patients with chronic lung diseases such as COPD, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is primarily characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. While patients with pulmonary hypertension may develop respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, these symptoms are not specific to acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Therefore, the presence of acute on chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension."
Alveolar hypoventilation,440376,True,"Yes, alveolar hypoventilation can be specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Alveolar hypoventilation refers to inadequate ventilation of the alveoli in the lungs, leading to decreased oxygen levels and increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood. In the context of Pulmonary Hypertension, alveolar hypoventilation can occur as a result of the impaired gas exchange and reduced lung function associated with the disease. This can contribute to the symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue seen in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, if a patient with Pulmonary Hypertension presents with alveolar hypoventilation, it is likely a specific manifestation of the disease."
Right ventricular abnormality,4101621,True,"Yes, a right ventricular abnormality is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. In Pulmonary Hypertension, the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leads to right ventricular dysfunction, ultimately resulting in heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has a right ventricular abnormality, it is highly likely that they have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Right ventricular failure,4273632,True,"Yes, right ventricular failure is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. In Pulmonary Hypertension, the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately right heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has right ventricular failure, it is highly likely that they have Pulmonary Hypertension as well."
Cor pulmonale,4307356,True,"Yes, cor pulmonale is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Cor pulmonale is a condition characterized by right ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction secondary to pulmonary hypertension. It is a complication of pulmonary hypertension, as the elevated pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leads to increased workload on the right ventricle, eventually causing right heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has cor pulmonale, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension as the underlying cause."
Fibromatosis,37109980,False,"No, fibromatosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Fibromatosis, also known as desmoid tumors, is a rare type of tumor that arises from connective tissue. It is not directly related to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, which involves elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction. While patients with fibromatosis may present with symptoms such as pain or a palpable mass, these symptoms are not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having fibromatosis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Neonatal cardiovascular disorder,4180943,False,"No, neonatal cardiovascular disorder is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Neonatal cardiovascular disorder is a broad term that encompasses various heart conditions that can affect newborns, including congenital heart defects, arrhythmias, and structural abnormalities. While pulmonary hypertension can be a component of some neonatal cardiovascular disorders, it is not the only condition that falls under this category. Therefore, having a neonatal cardiovascular disorder does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic pulmonary embolism,44782732,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic pulmonary embolism is a condition characterized by the presence of a blood clot in the pulmonary arteries, leading to impaired blood flow to the lungs. While chronic pulmonary embolism can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all cases of chronic pulmonary embolism will result in pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having chronic pulmonary embolism does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Hereditary nephropathy,45757752,False,"No, hereditary nephropathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Hereditary nephropathy refers to a group of inherited kidney diseases that affect the structure and function of the kidneys. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as fatigue and fluid retention, hereditary nephropathy primarily affects the kidneys, not the pulmonary vasculature or heart. Pulmonary hypertension, on the other hand, is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Therefore, having hereditary nephropathy does not definitively mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."
Mitochondrial cytopathy,81539,False,"No, mitochondrial cytopathy is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Mitochondrial cytopathy refers to a group of disorders caused by abnormalities in the mitochondria, which are responsible for producing energy in cells. These disorders can affect various organs and systems in the body, leading to a wide range of symptoms depending on the specific type of mitochondrial dysfunction. While mitochondrial dysfunction can potentially impact the cardiovascular system and contribute to heart failure, it is not a defining characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having mitochondrial cytopathy does not necessarily mean that an individual will have pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary sarcoidosis,4086243,False,"No.

Rationale:
Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a condition characterized by the formation of granulomas in the lungs, which can lead to symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. While pulmonary sarcoidosis can potentially lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis will develop pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having pulmonary sarcoidosis does not definitively mean that a person will have pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiovascular system complication of procedure,43022062,False,"No, the condition ""Cardiovascular system complication of procedure"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with Pulmonary Hypertension may undergo procedures that could potentially lead to cardiovascular complications, the presence of a cardiovascular system complication of a procedure does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is a specific condition characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, which is diagnosed through specific hemodynamic criteria and clinical evaluation."
Histiocytic syndrome,4130197,False,"No, histiocytic syndrome is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Histiocytic syndrome refers to a group of rare disorders characterized by an overproduction of histiocytes, a type of white blood cell. These disorders can affect various organs and systems in the body, leading to a wide range of symptoms depending on the specific subtype of histiocytic syndrome. While some forms of histiocytic syndrome may involve pulmonary manifestations, it is not a defining feature of the condition. Therefore, having histiocytic syndrome does not necessarily mean that a person will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic right-sided heart failure,4014159,True,"Yes, chronic right-sided heart failure is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Chronic right-sided heart failure is a common complication of Pulmonary Hypertension, as the elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leads to right ventricular dysfunction. This dysfunction ultimately results in heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has chronic right-sided heart failure, it is highly likely that they also have Pulmonary Hypertension. However, not all patients with Pulmonary Hypertension will necessarily develop chronic right-sided heart failure, as the progression of the disease can vary among individuals."
Chronic cor pulmonale,4195892,True,"Yes, chronic cor pulmonale is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Chronic cor pulmonale is a condition characterized by right ventricular hypertrophy and eventually right heart failure due to chronic pulmonary hypertension. It is a complication of pulmonary hypertension, specifically affecting the right side of the heart as a result of increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, if a patient has chronic cor pulmonale, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension."
Cardiovascular system hereditary disorder,4179992,False,"No, the condition ""Cardiovascular system hereditary disorder"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can be hereditary in some cases, not all hereditary cardiovascular disorders lead to Pulmonary Hypertension. There are various other cardiovascular conditions that can be hereditary and do not necessarily result in Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having a hereditary cardiovascular disorder does not definitively mean that an individual will have Pulmonary Hypertension."
Pulmonary vein finding,4119821,False,"No, the condition ""Pulmonary vein finding"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary vein findings may indicate other conditions such as pulmonary vein stenosis, pulmonary vein thrombosis, or pulmonary vein obstruction, which are not necessarily indicative of Pulmonary Hypertension. Pulmonary Hypertension is specifically characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, as assessed by right heart catheterization. Therefore, having a pulmonary vein finding does not definitively mean that a person has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Infection by Schistosoma,436038,False,"No.

Rationale: Infection by Schistosoma is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Schistosoma infection can lead to pulmonary hypertension in some cases, it is not a defining characteristic of the infection. Pulmonary Hypertension can have various etiologies, as mentioned in the description, and infection by Schistosoma is just one of many possible causes. Therefore, having an infection by Schistosoma does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Langerhans cell histiocytosis,4278365,False,"No

Rationale: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by an overproduction of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. It primarily affects children but can also occur in adults. While Langerhans cell histiocytosis can affect the lungs and cause pulmonary involvement, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having Langerhans cell histiocytosis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary thrombosis,4239826,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary thrombosis refers to the formation of a blood clot in the pulmonary vasculature, which can lead to pulmonary embolism. While pulmonary thrombosis can contribute to pulmonary hypertension in some cases, it is not specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can have various causes, including but not limited to pulmonary thrombosis. Therefore, having pulmonary thrombosis does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Biventricular congestive heart failure,4242669,True,"Yes, biventricular congestive heart failure is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Biventricular congestive heart failure is a condition where both the left and right ventricles of the heart are not functioning properly, leading to a backup of blood in the lungs and body. In the case of pulmonary hypertension, the elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure. Therefore, if a patient has biventricular congestive heart failure, it is likely that they also have pulmonary hypertension as a result of the right ventricular dysfunction caused by the elevated pulmonary pressures."
Angiomatosis,4006951,False,"No, angiomatosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Angiomatosis refers to a condition characterized by the presence of multiple small blood vessel tumors (angiomas) in various organs of the body. While angiomatosis can potentially affect the lungs and pulmonary vasculature, it is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is specifically related to elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, which is not directly caused by angiomatosis. Therefore, having angiomatosis does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Capillary hemangioma,4291592,False,"No

Rationale: Capillary hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that typically presents as a red or purple raised lesion on the skin or mucous membranes. It is not directly related to pulmonary hypertension, which is a condition affecting the pulmonary vasculature and right heart function. While capillary hemangiomas can occur in various locations throughout the body, they are not a known risk factor or symptom of pulmonary hypertension."
Acute right-sided heart failure,4233424,True,"Yes, acute right-sided heart failure is specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

In Pulmonary Hypertension, elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately, heart failure. Acute right-sided heart failure is a manifestation of this process, as the right ventricle is unable to effectively pump blood to the lungs due to the increased pulmonary pressures. Therefore, if a patient has acute right-sided heart failure, it is highly likely that they have Pulmonary Hypertension as the underlying cause."
Right heart failure secondary to left heart failure,4195785,False,"No, right heart failure secondary to left heart failure is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While right heart failure can be a complication of Pulmonary Hypertension due to the increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature leading to right ventricular dysfunction, it can also occur as a result of left heart failure. In this case, the primary cause of the right heart failure is left heart failure, not Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having right heart failure secondary to left heart failure does not definitively indicate the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension."
Hypertension secondary to drug,4108213,False,"No, the condition ""Hypertension secondary to drug"" is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While drug-induced hypertension can be a potential cause of secondary pulmonary hypertension, there are many other possible causes of drug-induced hypertension that do not necessarily lead to Pulmonary Hypertension. Therefore, having drug-induced hypertension does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Chronic drug-induced interstitial lung disorders,4112814,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic drug-induced interstitial lung disorders are not specific to pulmonary hypertension. While drug-induced lung disorders can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication, not all cases of chronic drug-induced interstitial lung disorders will result in pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having chronic drug-induced interstitial lung disorders does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Neurofibroma,4300676,False,"No, neurofibroma is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Neurofibroma is a benign nerve sheath tumor that arises from the cells that cover nerves. It is typically associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on nerves. While neurofibromas can occur in various parts of the body, they are not directly related to pulmonary hypertension. The presence of neurofibroma does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension, as they are two distinct medical conditions with different etiologies and pathophysiology."
High output heart failure,4004279,False,"No

Rationale: High output heart failure is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. High output heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to meet the body's demands despite normal or elevated cardiac output. It can be caused by conditions such as anemia, hyperthyroidism, arteriovenous fistulas, or Paget's disease. While pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, not all cases of high output heart failure are directly related to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having high output heart failure does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis,4174275,True,"Yes, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis is specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare lung disease that can lead to pulmonary hypertension as a complication. It is characterized by the abnormal growth of smooth muscle cells in the lungs, which can obstruct blood flow and lead to increased pulmonary arterial pressure. Therefore, if a patient has pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of the disease process."
Inflammatory disorder of mediastinum,4189294,False,"No

Rationale: An inflammatory disorder of the mediastinum is a broad term that can encompass various conditions affecting the tissues and structures within the mediastinum, which is the area in the middle of the chest between the lungs. While inflammation in the mediastinum can potentially lead to complications such as compression of nearby structures or infection, it is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is specifically characterized by elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to right ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Inflammatory disorders of the mediastinum may or may not be associated with pulmonary hypertension, but having an inflammatory disorder of the mediastinum does not definitively mean that a person has pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease,4232485,True,"Yes, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare form of pulmonary hypertension characterized by obstruction of the small veins in the lungs, leading to increased pulmonary arterial pressure and right heart dysfunction. PVOD is considered a subtype of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and falls under the broader category of pulmonary hypertension. Patients with PVOD may present with similar symptoms as other forms of pulmonary hypertension, such as dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of right heart failure. 

Given that PVOD is a subtype of pulmonary hypertension, if a patient is diagnosed with PVOD, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have PVOD, as there are various other causes and subtypes of pulmonary hypertension."
Sclerosing mediastinitis,4249898,True,"Yes, sclerosing mediastinitis is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Sclerosing mediastinitis is a rare condition characterized by fibrosis and inflammation in the mediastinum, which can lead to compression of nearby structures such as the airways, blood vessels, and esophagus. In some cases, sclerosing mediastinitis can lead to pulmonary hypertension due to the compression of pulmonary vessels, resulting in elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Therefore, if a patient has sclerosing mediastinitis, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a complication of the condition. However, not all patients with pulmonary hypertension will have sclerosing mediastinitis, as there are various other causes of pulmonary hypertension as mentioned in the description of the malady."
Chronic hemolytic anemia,45768941,True,"Yes, chronic hemolytic anemia can be specific to pulmonary hypertension. Chronic hemolytic anemia is a condition where red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be produced, leading to a decrease in the number of circulating red blood cells. This can result in an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, as the destruction of red blood cells can lead to an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and ultimately elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Therefore, if a patient has chronic hemolytic anemia, they may develop pulmonary hypertension as a result of this condition."
Acquired hemangiomatosis,4111945,False,"No, acquired hemangiomatosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Acquired hemangiomatosis is a rare vascular disorder characterized by multiple cutaneous and visceral hemangiomas. While it can present with symptoms such as dyspnea and chest pain, it is not a defining feature of pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria for acquired hemangiomatosis are distinct from those of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having acquired hemangiomatosis does not definitively mean that an individual has pulmonary hypertension."
Obesity associated disorder,4176962,False,"No

Rationale: Pulmonary Hypertension can be associated with various conditions such as connective tissue diseases, congenital heart defects, or chronic lung diseases, but obesity alone is not a specific condition that definitively indicates the presence of Pulmonary Hypertension. While obesity can be a risk factor for developing PH, it is not a specific indicator of the disease. Therefore, having an obesity-associated disorder does not necessarily mean that an individual definitely has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Indian childhood cirrhosis,4268006,False,"No, Indian childhood cirrhosis is not specific to pulmonary hypertension. Indian childhood cirrhosis is a rare form of liver disease that primarily affects children in India, leading to liver failure and cirrhosis. While there may be some overlap in symptoms such as fatigue and potentially right heart failure in advanced cases, Indian childhood cirrhosis is not a known cause or associated condition of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, having Indian childhood cirrhosis does not definitively mean that a person will also have pulmonary hypertension."
Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis,4121621,True,"Yes, pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis is specific to pulmonary hypertension.

Rationale:
Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis is a rare form of pulmonary hypertension characterized by the proliferation of capillaries within the lung tissue, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and ultimately, pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient is diagnosed with pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension."
Chronic pulmonary thromboembolism without pulmonary hypertension,45771016,False,"No.

Rationale: Chronic pulmonary thromboembolism without pulmonary hypertension refers to the presence of chronic blood clots in the pulmonary arteries without the associated elevated blood pressure within the pulmonary vasculature characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. While chronic pulmonary thromboembolism can lead to pulmonary hypertension in some cases, the presence of chronic pulmonary thromboembolism alone does not definitively indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, the condition is not specific to the malady of pulmonary hypertension."
CK syndrome,36676440,False,"No, CK syndrome is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. CK syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, and abnormal physical features. There is no known association between CK syndrome and Pulmonary Hypertension based on current medical knowledge."
Acute on chronic right-sided congestive heart failure,37309625,True,"Yes, acute on chronic right-sided congestive heart failure is specific to pulmonary hypertension. 

Rationale: Pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and ultimately heart failure, specifically right-sided heart failure. Acute on chronic right-sided congestive heart failure is a manifestation of the right heart failure that can occur in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has acute on chronic right-sided congestive heart failure, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension."
Autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia due to G6PC3 deficiency,37204406,False,"No, autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia due to G6PC3 deficiency is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. 

Autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia due to G6PC3 deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a decrease in the number of neutrophils in the blood, leading to an increased risk of infections. This condition primarily affects the immune system and does not directly involve the pulmonary vasculature or right ventricular dysfunction, which are key features of Pulmonary Hypertension. While patients with severe congenital neutropenia may have other medical conditions or complications, there is no direct association between this specific genetic disorder and Pulmonary Hypertension."
Developmental hereditary disorder,4180651,False,"No, the condition of a developmental hereditary disorder is not specific to Pulmonary Hypertension. While Pulmonary Hypertension can be hereditary in some cases, not all cases of Pulmonary Hypertension are due to a developmental hereditary disorder. There are various other causes of Pulmonary Hypertension, as mentioned in the description, such as idiopathic, drug-induced, or associated with other conditions like connective tissue diseases or chronic lung diseases. Therefore, having a developmental hereditary disorder does not definitively mean that an individual has Pulmonary Hypertension."
Familial pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis,4121809,True,"Yes, familial pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis is specific to pulmonary hypertension. Familial pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis is a rare form of pulmonary hypertension characterized by the proliferation of capillary-sized blood vessels within the lung tissue. This condition is considered a subtype of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), which is a rare and severe form of pulmonary hypertension. Patients with familial pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis typically present with symptoms of pulmonary hypertension, such as dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of right heart failure. Diagnosis involves a thorough clinical assessment, imaging studies, and right heart catheterization to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, if a patient has familial pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis, they definitely have pulmonary hypertension."
